Used with 
the -P option, setsebool sets the Boolean you indicate permanently. For example, to 
allow Samba to share any ﬁ le or directory with read-only permission from the server, you 
could type the following from a shell as root user:

# setsebool -P samba_export_all_ro on
# getsebool samba_export_all_ro
samba_export_all_ro --> on

The setsebool command sets the Boolean, in this case to on.
