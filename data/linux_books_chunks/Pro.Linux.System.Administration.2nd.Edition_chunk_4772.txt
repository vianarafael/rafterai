For example, when we require information that is normally contained in the 
/etc/passwd file (like username), we first look in that file. If the username is not found in the file, we then 
query the sssd daemon (or sss). The same applies for group and shadow.

The next part we need to update is the PAM authentication modules. We need to allow us to use 
sss(d) for authentication via PAM.
