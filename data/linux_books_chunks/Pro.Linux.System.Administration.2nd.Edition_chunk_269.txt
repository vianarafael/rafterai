You can run a RAM tester like memtest86 
(www.memtest.org/), and you should verify that the CPU and case fans are working properly.

Diagnostic Information
If you need additional diagnostic information while you are installing, you can access a limited shell and 
some logging information from the installation process. You can use these to further diagnose any problems 
you might have.
