For example, suppose that you want to remove write permission for “other” 
without changing any other permission bits on a set of ﬁ les and directories. You could do 
the following:

$ chmod -R o-w $HOME/myapps

This example recursively removes write permissions for “other” on any ﬁ les and directories 
below the myapps directory.
