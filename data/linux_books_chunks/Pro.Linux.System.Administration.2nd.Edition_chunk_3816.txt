Taking a look at df shows the following:

$ df -h /mnt
Filesystem           Size  Used   Avail  Use%    Mounted on
au-mel-dfs-1:/vol1   50G   33M    50G    1%      /mnt

As shown, we have our 50GB volume mounted successfully. We can do a write test to see whether we 
can write data to it. For this we are going to use a for loop bash one-liner.
