When creating your schema file, you must remember to make 
the names for your object classes and attributes unique.

It is good practice to add a prefix to all your created attributes and classes to make sure they are unique. 

Suppose we wanted to add an attribute ourselves that would allow us to know when a user has been 
disabled.
