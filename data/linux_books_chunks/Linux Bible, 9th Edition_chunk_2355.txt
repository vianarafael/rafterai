The 
next step is to copy that key over to a remote user, so I can use key-based authentication 
each time I connect to that user account with ssh tools:

 $ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub johndoe@10.140.67.23
johndoe@10.140.67.23's password: 
***************
Now try logging into the machine, with "ssh 'johndoe@10.140.67.23'",
and check in:
  .ssh/authorized_keys
to make sure we haven't added extra keys that you weren't expecting.

When prompted, I entered johndoeâ€™s password.
