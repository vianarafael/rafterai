You can leave those in 
place. The main point is to have your Samba rules placed somewhere before the ﬁ nal 
REJECT rules.

If your iptables ﬁ rewall is enabled, you can restart it to have the new rules take effect. 
To do that, type systemctl restart iptables.service (in older Fedora systems) or 
service restart iptables (in RHEL 6 or earlier).
