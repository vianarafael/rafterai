If you donâ€™t, any output is sent to the user that ran the crontab 
-e command (in this case, root).

In a crontab fi le, you can have a range of numbers, a list of numbers, or skip numbers. For example, 
1, 5, or 17 in the fi rst fi eld causes the command to be run 1, 5, and 17 minutes after the hour.
