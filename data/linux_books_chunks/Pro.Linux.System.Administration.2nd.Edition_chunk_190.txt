Selecting Begin Installation

After selecting Begin Installation you presented with a screen that shows your installation progress and 
also gives you the opportunity to create a “root” password and a “user” password. In Linux the root user is a 
superuser who has access to the whole system, much like the Windows Administrator in the Windows OS.
