For example, either of these two commands can be 
used to see if the DNS server at 192.168.0.254 can resolve the hostname 
www.google.com into an IP address. Repeat this for each name server’s IP address 
until you ﬁ nd which ones work:

# host www.google.com 192.168.0.254
# dig @192.168.0.254 www.google.com
