The htpasswd command can create a .htpasswd file that contains a userid
and an (encrypted) password.

This screenshot creates a user and password for the hacker named cliff and uses the -c flag
to create the .htpasswd file.

root@debian7:~# htpasswd -c /var/www/.htpasswd cliff 
New password:
Re-type new password:
Adding password for user cliff
root@debian7:~# cat /var/www/.htpasswd
cliff:$apr1$vujll0KL$./SZ4w9q0swhX93pQ0PVp.

Hacker rob also wants access, this screenshot shows how to add a second user and password
to .htpasswd.

root@debian7:~# htpasswd /var/www/.htpasswd rob 
New password:
Re-type new password:
Adding password for user rob
root@debian7:~# cat /var/www/.htpasswd 
cliff:$apr1$vujll0KL$./SZ4w9q0swhX93pQ0PVp.
rob:$apr1$HNln1FFt$nRlpF0H.IW11/1DRq4lQo0

Both  Cliff  and  Rob  chose  the  same  password  (hunter2),  but  that  is  not  visible  in  the
.htpasswd file because of the different salts.

Next we need to create a .htaccess file in the DocumentRoot of the website we want to
protect.
