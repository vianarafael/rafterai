When a 
process is running, you can change the nice value using the renice command, along with 
the process ID of the process, as in the example that follows:

# nice +5 updatedb &

6

The updatedb command is used to generate the locate database manually by gathering 
names of ﬁ les throughout the ﬁ le system.
