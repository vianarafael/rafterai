I 
ran the top command to make sure that the nice value was set properly:

PID USER        PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
20284 root      25   5 98.7m  932  644 D  2.7  0.0   0:00.96 updatedb

Notice that under the NI column, the nice value is set to 5. Because the command was 
run as the root user, the root user can lower the nice value later by using the renice 
command.
