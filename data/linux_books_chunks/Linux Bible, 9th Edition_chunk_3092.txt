To verify which ports are being used by the httpd server, use the netstat command:

# netstat -tupln | grep httpd
tcp6   0      0 :::80         :::*          LISTEN     29169/httpd
tcp6   0      0 :::443        :::*          LISTEN     29169/httpd

The output shows that the httpd daemon (process ID 29169) is listening on all addresses 
for port 80 (:::80) and port 443 (:::443).
