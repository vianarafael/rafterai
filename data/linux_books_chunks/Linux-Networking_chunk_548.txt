primary and secondary

When you set up the first authoritative dns server for a zone, then this is called the primary
dns server. This server will have a readable and writable copy of the zone database. For
reasons of fault tolerance, performance or load balancing you may decide to set up another
dns server with authority over that zone. This is called a secondary dns server.
