You can share any directory containing the space you want to 
share. Consider making a new directory and mounting a whole disk or partition on 
it. For this example, I create a directory named /var/storage:

# mkdir -p /var/storage

b.  Allow exporting. On your storage system, create an entry in the /etc/exports 
Ô¨Å le to share the directory with selected systems (by name or IP address).
