In this scenario, the http:// traffic is 
redirected to https://. It does this by adding these lines to our virtual host configuration:

<VirtualHost *:80>
...
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} =www.example.com
RewriteRule ^ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [END,QSA,R=permanent]
</VirtualHost>

The certbot command also creates a new file to contain our SSL configuration.
