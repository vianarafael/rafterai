These are defined in the services 
xml files and we can also use ports if you need to.

If you want to permanently change the zone for an interface you can modify the network interface with 

nmcli:

$ sudo nmcli c modify enp0s9 connection.zone dmz

This will add the ‘ZONE=dmz’ to the interface profile file /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s9.
