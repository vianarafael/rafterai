Graphite Installation

The Graphite components are easily installed using the common packaging tools, YUM and Apt, or via Pip 
(the Python packaging tool).

On CentOS you can install Graphite with the following:

$ sudo yum install -y python-carbon

This will install carbon-cache and the Whisper database (python-whisper).
