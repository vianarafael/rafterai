history of tcp/ip

In the Sixties development of the tcp/ip protocol stack was started by the US Department of
Defense. In the Eighties a lot of commercial enterprises developed their own protocol stack:
IBM created sna, Novell had ipx/spx, Microsoft completed netbeui and Apple worked with
appletalk. All the efforts from the Eighties failed to survive the Nineties.
