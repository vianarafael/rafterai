The Firewall 
Conﬁ guration window (firewall-config command) provides an easy way to open ports 
on your ﬁ rewall and do masquerading (routing private addresses to a public network) 
or port forwarding. The firewalld service can react to changes in conditions, which 
the static iptables service can’t do as well on its own.
