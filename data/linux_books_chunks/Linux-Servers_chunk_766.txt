First
we need to add the relevant section in smb.conf.

[Profiles]
 comment = User Profiles
 path = /srv/samba/profiles
 readonly = No
 profile acls = Yes

Besides the share section, we also need to set the location of the profiles share (this can be
another Samba server) in the global section.

logon path = \\%L\Profiles\%U

The  %L  variable  is  the  name  of  this  Samba  server,  the  %U  variable  translates  to  the
username.
