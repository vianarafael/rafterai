Adding Zone Update Definitions in dhcpd.conf

zone 0.168.192.in-addr.arpa. {
    key dynamic-update-key;
    primary 192.168.0.1;
}
zone example.com. {
    key dynamic-update-key;
    primary 192.168.0.1;
}

We restart the DHCP server as well, and when that is done, the server-side configuration is complete.
