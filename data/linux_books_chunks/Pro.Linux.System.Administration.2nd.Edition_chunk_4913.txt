We are unqualified to verify the first two statements, but the third statement is 
correct.

There are four components to Graphite.

•	

Carbon: A high-performance listener for receiving time-series data

•	 Whisper: A time-series database for metrics data

•	 Graphite-web: A web UI that renders graphs and dashboards

•	 Graphite-API: An API that fetches JSON data from the time-series Whisper database

In this exercise we are going to be installing Carbon, the time-series Whisper database and the 

Graphite-API.
