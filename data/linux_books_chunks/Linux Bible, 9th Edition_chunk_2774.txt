The state of static is essentially enabled, and thus 
should be included.

To see if a particular service is running, use the following command:

# systemctl status cups.service
cups.service - CUPS Printing Service
  Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/cups.service; enabled)
  Active: active (running) since Mon, 30 Apr 12:36:31 -0400; 13h ago
  Main PID: 1315 (cupsd)
   CGroup: name=systemd:/system/cups.service
          â””  1315 /usr/sbin/cupsd -f

The systemctl command can be used to show the status of a single service.
