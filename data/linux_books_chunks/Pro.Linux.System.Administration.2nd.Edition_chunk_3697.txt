The [sysvol] service is 
required by each domain controller and is a folder that is replicated on other domain controllers.

We are going to add the following to the section at the end of the file to set up a sales share that 

members of the sales group can share:

[sales]
        comment = shared sales directory
        path = /data/staff/sales
        readonly = yes
        public = no
        browseable = yes
        valid users = +SAMBA\sales
        write list = jsmith, bsingh
        force create mode = 0770
        force directory mode = 2770
        create mask = 0770
        directory mask = 2770
        force group = sales
        force user = exbackup

We have added a share called [sales].
