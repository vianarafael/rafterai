Other popular extensions include NotiÔ¨Å cations Alert (which alerts you of unread 
 messages), Presentation Mode (which prevents the screensaver from coming on when you 
are giving a presentation), and Music Integration (which integrates popular music players 
into GNOME 3 so you are alerted about songs being played).

Because the Extensions site can keep track of your extensions, you can click the Installed 
extensions button at the top of the page and see every extension that is installed.
