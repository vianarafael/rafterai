For more information on mount options, please see the man 
page for mount.

To set this to automatically mount when our host is rebooted, we would add this to the /etc/fstab file:

192.168.0.1:/ /data/remote nfs4 rw,hard,intr,_netdev 0 0

Here we are accessing the NFS filesystem from host 192.168.0.1 and mounting the remote shares 
under the /data/remote directory.
