The 
following is an example of the ps command:

$ ps u
USER   PID %CPU %MEM  VSZ    RSS   TTY    STAT  START  TIME  COMMAND
jake   2147 0.0  0.7 1836   1020   tty1   S+    14:50  0:00  -bash
jake   2310 0.0  0.7 2592    912   tty1   R+    18:22  0:00  ps u

In this example, the u option asks that usernames be shown, as well as other  information 
such as the time the process started and memory and CPU usage for processes  associated 
with the current user.
