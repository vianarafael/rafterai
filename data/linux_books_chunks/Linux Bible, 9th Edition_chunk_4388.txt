Notice that one of the auth contexts is ignored because its 
line starts with a # character:

$ cat /etc/pam.d/poweroff
#%PAM-1.0
auth       sufficient   pam_rootok.so
auth       required     pam_console.so
#auth       include      system-auth
account    required     pam_permit.so

The auth context is listed twice in the conﬁ guration ﬁ le shown in the preceding code.
