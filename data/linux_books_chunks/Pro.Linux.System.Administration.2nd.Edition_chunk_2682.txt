Letâ€™s set the default to six 
hours and the maximum to 24 hours.

default-lease-time 21600;
max-lease-time 86400;

With that done, we can add a subnet on which our DHCP server should hand out leases.

subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
}

The DHCP server will check the network addresses assigned to the local network interfaces when it 

starts and automatically assign each subnet declaration to the correct network interface.

We can now add subnet-specific options within this configuration block.
