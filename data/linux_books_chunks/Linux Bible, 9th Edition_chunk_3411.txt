There are also man pages for 
Samba commands, such as smbpasswd (to change passwords), smbclient (to connect to 
a Samba server), and nmblookup (to look up NetBIOS information).

After you have installed Samba packages and completed a quick survey of what they 
 contain, try starting up the Samba service and see what you get in a default conﬁ guration.

Starting and Stopping Samba
With samba and samba-common installed, you can start the server and investigate how 
it runs in the default conﬁ guration.
