Here the possible errors during the boot stage (taken from the LILO README)

• nothing

LILO is either not installed or the partition isn't active

• L The first stage loader has been loaded but the second stage has failed 

• LI The second stage boot loader has loaded but was unable to execute

This could be cause if /boot/boot.b moved and /sbin/lilo wasn't rerun

• LIL The second stage boot loader has been started, but it can't load the descriptor 
table from the map file or the second stage boot loader has been loaded at an 
incorrect address

This could be cause if /boot/boot.b moved and /sbin/lilo wasn't rerun.

• LIL- The descriptor table is corrupt  

This could be cause if /boot/map moved and /sbin/lilo wasn't rerun.

• Scrolling 010101 errors   This happens when the second stage boot loader is on a 

slave device
