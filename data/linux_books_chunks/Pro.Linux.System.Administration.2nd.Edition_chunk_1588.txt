As we have said, by default, iptables configures all chains with a policy of ACCEPT, 
and it is best practice to set this to a policy of DROP for all chains is recommended – but only after careful 
consideration as this can stop all network traffic if done incorrectly.

 ■ Caution 
Make sure you have configured ACCEPT rules that allow you to connect before changing the policy to DROP.

 on remote hosts it is very easy to isolate the host from the network you are using to configure it.
