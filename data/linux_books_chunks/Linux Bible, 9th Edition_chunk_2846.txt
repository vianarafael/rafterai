For example:

#   chkconfig: 2345 25 10

When you add the service script in a later step, the chkconfig command reads that line to 
set runlevels at which the service starts (2, 3, 4, and 5), its run order when the script is set 
to start (25), and its kill order when it is set to stop (10).

Check the boot order in the default runlevel before adding your own script.
