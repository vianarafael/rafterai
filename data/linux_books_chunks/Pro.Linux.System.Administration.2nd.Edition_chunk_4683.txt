As we have 
mentioned earlier, if you have SASL set up, you can bind without sending the password across the wire, 
with the simple authentication method the password is sent to be verified on the LDAP server, so it should 
be sent over a secure transport like TLS. The -x will make ldapadd use the simple method. -W tells ldapadd 
that we want to be prompted for a password.
