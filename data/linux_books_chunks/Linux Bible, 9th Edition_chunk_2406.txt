By installing sysstat and enabling 
the sysstat service, your system immediately begins gathering system activity data 
that can be reviewed later using certain options to the sar command. The data  gathering 
is done by a crontab conﬁ guration ﬁ le (/etc/cron.d/sysstat) that is launched at 
 regular intervals.
