If you have a mailbox that is 

known to be full of spam, you can train your filters by issuing the following:

$ sudo sa-learn --showdots --mbox --spam file-of-spam

You should also teach your filter about ham, and to do that, you would issue the following:

$ sudo sa-learn --showdots --mbox --ham file-of-ham

We can also look at our actual e-mail and see the details of the headers SpamAssassin has added.

X-Spam-Checker-Version: The SpamAssassin version

X-Spam-Level: The total score in asterisks

X-Spam-Flag: Present only if e-mail is identified as spam

X-Spam-Status: The spam status (No or Yes), the total the e-mail scored, and a list of 
the spam tests checked

X-Spam-Report: The breakdown of how the spam score was derived

X-Spam-Prev-Subject: The previous spam subject heading

The first three in the list are added to all e-mail; the last three are added only if the e-mail is considered 

spam.
