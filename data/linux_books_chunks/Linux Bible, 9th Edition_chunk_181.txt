What that means is:

 ■ You cannot see the code used to create the operating system.

 ■ You, therefore, cannot change the operating system at its most basic levels if it 

doesn’t suit your needs—and you can’t use the operating system to build your own 
operating system from source code.

 ■ You cannot check the code to ﬁ nd bugs, explore security vulnerabilities, or simply 

learn what that code is doing.

 ■ You may not be able to easily plug your own software into the operating system if 
the creators of that system don’t want to expose the programming interfaces you 
need to the outside world.

You might look at those statements about proprietary software and say, “What do I care? I’m 
not a software developer.
