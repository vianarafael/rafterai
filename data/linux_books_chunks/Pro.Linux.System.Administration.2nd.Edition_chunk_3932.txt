You can see that we have listed the contents of our .ssh directory, and we have the two 
keys, one private and one public, as indicated by the .pub suffix. We keep the private one (exbackup) secured 
on this host, and we copy the contents of the public key (exbackup.pub) to the authorized_keys file for the 
user on our remote host.

We need to now talk a little about security.
