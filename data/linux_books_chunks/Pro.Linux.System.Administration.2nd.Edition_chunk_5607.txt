Finally, there’s 
MCollective, an orchestration tool for managing Puppet nodes.

On the master, you install the puppetserver, and this will install facter, hiera, the agent, and other 

required packages from the Puppet repository.

$ sudo yum install puppetserver

On the Puppet nodes, or clients, we can install the puppet-agent package by itself, and it will contain or 

require all that it needs to run.

$ sudo yum install –y puppet-agent

This of course will require the installation of the YUM repository, like earlier, first.

Ubuntu Installation

On Ubuntu, we again install the apt repository and then install puppetserver on the master server, which 
will bring down all the necessary Puppet components, like Facter and Hiera and the agent.

On the server or master, we need to do this:

$ wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-xenial.deb -O xenial.deb && sudo 
dpkg -i xenial.deb
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y puppetserver

On the client, you need the following:
$ sudo apt-get install –y puppet-agent

You will now have all the necessary components installed on your systems.
