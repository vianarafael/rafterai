It simply uses an FTP style of interaction between a client and an sshd server.

The following example shows the user johndoe connecting to jd.example.com:

$ sftp johndoe@jd.example.com
Connecting to jd.example.com
johndoe@jd.example.com's password: ***************
sftp>

At this point, you can begin an interactive FTP session.
