The following are examples of commands to run 
on the server:

# mkdir /var/ftp/uploads
# chown ftp:ftp /var/ftp/uploads
# chmod 775 /var/ftp/uploads

As long as the ﬁ rewall is open and SELinux Booleans are set properly, an anonymous user 
can cd to the uploads directory and put a ﬁ le from the user’s local system into the uploads 
directory.
