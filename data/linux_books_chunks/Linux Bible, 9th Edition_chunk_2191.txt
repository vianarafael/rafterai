Suppose you want to remount /dev/sdb1 as read/write, but you do not want to 
unmount it (maybe someone is using it). You could use the remount option as follows:

# mount -t ext3 -o remount,rw /dev/sdb1

Mounting a disk image in loopback
Another valuable way to use the mount command has to do with disk images.
