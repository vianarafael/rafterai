When the CD is ﬁ nished burning, eject it (or it may eject automatically) and mark

and name of the ISO image).

Now you’re ready to begin installing (or booting) the Linux distribution you just burned.

Burning CDs from a Linux command line
If you have no GUI, or you don’t mind working from the shell, you can use the cdrecord 
command to burn the ISOs.
