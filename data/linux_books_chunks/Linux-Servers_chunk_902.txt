This method is easy since we don't have to consider open files and we don't have to
skip virtual file systems like /dev or /sys . The offline cloning method can be broken down
into these steps:

1. Boot source and target server with a bootable CD
2. Partition, format and mount volumes on the target server
3. Copy files/partitions from source to target over the network

The first step is trivial.
