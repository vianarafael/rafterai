For example, to set the NetworkManager service so it never runs, 
type the following:

# systemctl mask NetworkManager.service
ln -s '/dev/null' '/etc/systemd/system/NetworkManager.service'

As the output shows, the NetworkManager.service Ô¨Å le in /etc is linked to /dev/
null. So even if someone tried to run that service, nothing would happen.
