So mail.info 
matches all messages from the mail service that are info level and above.

As for where the messages go, most messages are directed to Ô¨Å les in the /var/log  directory. 
You can, however, direct messages to a device (such as /dev/console) or a remote log host 
(such as @loghost.example.com).
