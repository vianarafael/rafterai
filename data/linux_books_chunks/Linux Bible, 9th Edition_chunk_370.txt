The X Window System provides a framework on 
which different types of desktop environments or simple window managers can be built.

The X Window System (sometimes simply called X) was created before Linux existed and even 
predates Microsoft Windows. It was built to be a lightweight, networked desktop framework.

X works in a sort of backward client/server model.
