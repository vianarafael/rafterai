Once it is started we can view which zones we have active:

$ sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
public
 interfaces: enp0s8 enp0s9

To get information about a zone, you can execute the following:

$ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --listâ€“all
public (default, active)
 interfaces: enp0s8 enp0s9
 sources:
 services: dhcpv6-client ssh
 ports:
 masquerade: no
 forward-ports:
 icmp-blocks:
 rich rules:

Here we can see that the public zone is the default and that it is active.
