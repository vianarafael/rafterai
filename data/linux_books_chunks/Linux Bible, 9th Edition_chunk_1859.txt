Having a user account 
provides you with an area in which to securely store Ô¨Å les, as well as a means of tailoring your user 
interface (GUI, path, environment variables, and so on) to suit the way that you use the computer.

You can add user accounts to most Linux systems in several ways. Fedora and Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux systems have a Users window available from the Settings Window.
