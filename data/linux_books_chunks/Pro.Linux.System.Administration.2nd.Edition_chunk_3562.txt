Here we have created a 2,048-bit private key (-b 2048) and a public key in the /etc/opendkim/keys 
directory (-D). We append the domain (-a), which appends our domain to the zone file stub. The â€“d says 
we are generating the keys for a particular domain. You can remove this if you want to use the same key for 
multiple domains.
