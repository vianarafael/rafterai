Keep in mind that you should use tools like nmap only on your own 
 systems, because scanning ports on other people’s computers can give the impression that you are trying to break in.

When you run the nmap utility, it provides a handy little report with information on the 
system you are scanning and the ports it sees. The ports are given a “state” status.
