All logs files rotate weekly, logs are rotated four times before they 
are deleted, new log files are created, rotated files have a date extension added to them, and the logrotate 
tool checks the logrotate.d directory for any new logrotate files. You can use other options, some of which 
are shown in TableÂ 18-2.
