The reason 
for doing this is that NetworkManager sometimes overwrites ﬁ les you conﬁ gure manually 
(from information gathered from DHCP or when using the NetworkManager GUI).

To turn NetworkManager off (immediately and permanently) on a RHEL 6 or older Fedora 
system, type the following as root (do this on a console because this procedure stops your 
networking if you are logged in over the network):

# service NetworkManager stop
# service network restart
# chkconfig NetworkManager off
# chkconfig network on

For RHEL 7 and newer Fedora systems that use the systemctl command to start, stop, 
enable, and disable services, you could type the following:

# systemctl stop NetworkManager.service
# systemctl disable NetworkManager.service
# systemctl restart network.service
# systemctl enable network.service

At this point, you can safely use the following sections to help you directly edit net-
work conﬁ guration ﬁ les.
