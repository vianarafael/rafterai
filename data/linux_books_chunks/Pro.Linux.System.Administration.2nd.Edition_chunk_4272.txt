Enter the virtual private network (VPN).
A VPN is, in essence, a private network that runs over a public, or hostile, network. VPNs are often 

called tunnels, and they are used to secure and protect traffic youâ€™d like to keep private over an otherwise 
public network like the Internet. VPNs can be initiated to and from network devices or to and from hosts.
