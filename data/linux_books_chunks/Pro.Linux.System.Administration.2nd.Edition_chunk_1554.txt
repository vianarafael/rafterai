Most Linux-based distributions will have an iptables package, but they may also have their own 
tool for configuring the rules Firewall-cmd and ufw.

Netfilter works by referring to a set of tables. These tables contain chains, which in turn contain 
individual rules. Chains hold groups of ordered and alike rules; for example, a group of rules governing 
incoming traffic could be held in a chain.
