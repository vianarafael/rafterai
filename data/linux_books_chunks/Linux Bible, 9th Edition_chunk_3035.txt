If Samba is set up properly on your computer and 
the client computers can reach you over the network, users should have no trouble ﬁ nding 
and using your printer.

For many Windows systems, click Start ➪ Devices and Printers and select the printer 
from the list to conﬁ gure it. In some older Windows systems, look for your shared Samba 
printer in Network Neighborhood (or My Network Places).
