While most of the procedures in this book 
will run well on Fedora, there are many references to how things are done differently in 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux because, when you go to get a job as a Linux system administra-
tor, you will, in most cases, be working with Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems.

Although the source code for Red Hat Enterprise Linux is freely available, the ISOs 
 containing the packages you install (often referred to as the binaries) are available only to 
those who have accounts on the Red Hat customer portal (https://access.redhat
.com) or through evaluation copies.

If you donâ€™t have an account, you can try signing up for a 30-day trial.
