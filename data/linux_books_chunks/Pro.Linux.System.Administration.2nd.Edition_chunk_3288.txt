Many people 
use MDas to sort e-mails from mailing lists into separate folders. MDas are also used to sort e-mail 
based on headers added by other applications; for example, many spam filters add headers indicating 
whether an e-mail is spam. MDas can read these headers and place e-mails into an appropriate 
folderâ€”for example, into a spam folder.
