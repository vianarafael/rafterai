When they reach zero, the nameserver will query the authoritative DNS 
server to see whether it has changed.

At the bottom of the dig output, you can see the SERVER that provided the response, 192.168.0.254, 

and how long the query took, 28 msec.

You can use dig to query a particular nameserver by using the @ sign, here we are using one of the 

Google public DNS servers.
