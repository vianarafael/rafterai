The following are methods used in the mkinitrd script to determine critical information 
about the root device and filesystem.

-The root filesystem type:

Using /etc/fstab the script determines which filesystem is used on the root device and 
the corresponding module (for example ext3 or xfs).

-Software RAID:

Using /etc/raidtab the mkinitrd script deduces the names of the raid arrays to start all 
the devices (even non root).

-LVM root device  

Once the root device $rootdev is determined in /etc/fstab the major number is 
obtained from the following line: 

root_major=$(/bin/ls -l $rootdev | awk '{ print $5 }')

If this corresponds to a logical volume, the logical volume commands are copied onto the 
ram disk.

The mkinitrd script will transfer all the required tools and modules to a file mounted as a 
loop device on a temporary directory.
