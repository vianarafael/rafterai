.config

Now  copy  a  working  .config  from  /boot  to  our  kernel  directory.  This  file  contains  the
configuration that was used for your current working kernel. It determines whether modules
are included in compilation or not.

[root@RHEL52 linux-2.6.18.i686]# cp /boot/config-2.6.18-92.1.18.el5 .config

28.5.4. make menuconfig

Now run make menuconfig (or the graphical make xconfig).
