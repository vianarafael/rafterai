To turn it on 
permanently, type this:

# setsebool -P ftp_home_dir on

18

 ■ For SELinux to allow anonymous users to read and write ﬁ les and directories, you 

need to turn on the allow_ftpd_anon_write Boolean:

# setsebool -P allow_ftpd_anon_write on

 ■ To be able to mount remote NFS or CIFS (Windows) shared ﬁ lesystems and share 
them from your vsftpd server, you need to turn on the following two Booleans, 
respectively:

# setsebool -P allow_ftpd_use_nfs on
# setsebool -P allow_ftpd_use_cifs on

If you ever ﬁ nd that you cannot access ﬁ les or directories from your FTP server that you 
believe should be accessible, try turning off SELinux temporarily:

# setenforce 0

If you can access the ﬁ les or directories with SELinux now in Permissive mode, put the 
system back in Enforcing mode (setenforce 1).
