We are going to build a 
nginx installation package as a deb, but the process works the same for a RPM package.

Starting with installing FPM, it comes as a Ruby Gem, a Gem being another way of packaging and

$ sudo aptitude install â€“y install ruby ruby-dev

If you are running CentOS:

$ sudo yum install -y ruby ruby-devel

The following steps are the same for CentOS as they are for Ubuntu.
