Let’s 

create that now.

$ sudo touch /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp

 ■ Note 

 Manifest files containing configuration have a suffix of .pp.

We’re also going to create three more directories at the base of our production directory, first site and 

in that directory profile and role.

$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/site/{profile,role}

The site directory is actually another module and, like role, will be used to contain specific role and 
profile information for this particular environment.
