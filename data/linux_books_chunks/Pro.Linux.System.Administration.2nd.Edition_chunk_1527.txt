The 10.204.2.10 host is in our ISP and is assigned to us by our 
ISP when we make our PPP connection.

On Host C we have this route configuration:

$ sudo /sbin/ip route show
192.168.1.0/24 dev enp0s8 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.0.220
default via 192.168.1.254 dev enp0s8 scope link

We know that Host A and Host C are on different networks, and by themselves they cannot reach 
each other.
