You can read about regular expressions further at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Regular_expression.

There are three regular expression versions you can use, BRe (basic regular expressions), eRe 
(extended regular expressions), and pCRe (perl regular expressions). Depending on your version of 
grep, there is no difference between BRe and eRe.
