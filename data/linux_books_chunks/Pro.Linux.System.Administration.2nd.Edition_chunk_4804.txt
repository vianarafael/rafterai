You can now set up a web GUI to manage your LDAP directory and integrate LDAP into your network 
and existing applications.

You should now be able to do the following:

•	

Install and configure OpenLDAP on Ubuntu and CentOS hosts

•	 Understand and configure access control lists

•	 Query and manage your LDAP directory

•	

•	

Install and configure the LAM web GUI

Set up single sign-on for Linux to LDAP

•	 Configure Apache web server to use LDAP authentication to authenticate client 

access

about this topic we have not even touched on in this chapter.
