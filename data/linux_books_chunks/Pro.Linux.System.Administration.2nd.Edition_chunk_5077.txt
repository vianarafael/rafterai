Letâ€™s look at a few rsyslog lines now:

Nov 30 00:54:25 backup systemd: Stopping System Logging Service...
Nov 30 00:54:25 backup systemd: Starting System Logging Service...
Nov 30 00:54:28 backup systemd: Started System Logging Service.

An rsyslog entry is constructed of a date, the name of the host that logged the entry (usually the service 
that emitted it), and the log data itself.
