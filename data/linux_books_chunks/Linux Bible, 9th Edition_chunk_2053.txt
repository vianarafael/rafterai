past few years, however, a new standard called Global Unique IdentiÔ¨Å ers (GUID) partition 
tables began being used on systems as part of the UEFI computer architecture to replace 
the older BIOS method of booting the system.

Some Linux partitioning tools have been updated to handle GUID partition tables. Other 
tools for handling GUID partition tables have been added.
