Try a simple rpm or 
yum command to make sure the databases are now in order.

Just as RPM has databases of locally installed packages, the Yum facility stores  information 
associated with Yum repositories in the local /var/cache/yum directory. Cached data 
includes metadata, headers, packages, and yum plug-in data.

If there is ever a problem with the data cached by yum, you can clean it out.
