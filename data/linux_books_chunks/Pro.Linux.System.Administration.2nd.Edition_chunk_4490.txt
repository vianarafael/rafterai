We then need to add 

the public cert that is produced to the /etc/ssl/certs directory along with the root CA if it is not already 
there, cacert.pem.

When the certificates are installed into the certs directory, we should change the ownership and 

permissions to the following:

$ sudo chown openldap:openldap –R /etc/ldap/certs
$ sudo chmod 600 /etc/ldap/certs/ldap.example.com.key

The user running the LDAP service on CentOS is ldap and would need to be used in the previous chown 

command.
