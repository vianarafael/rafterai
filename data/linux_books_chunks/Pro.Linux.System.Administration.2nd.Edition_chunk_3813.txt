Letâ€™s 

do that now with the following command:

$ sudo gluster volume start vol1
volume start: vol1: success

With that we have created and started our Gluster volume, and we are now ready to test that we can 

mount and write to it.

Testing GlusterFS

In this testing scenario, we are going to mount our Gluster volume onto another server. We are going to 
perform some write tests.
