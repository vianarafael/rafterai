a common pattern is to direct all e-mail for system users to the 
root user and then redirect the root user to someone who needs to see this e-mail, for example:

postmaster: root
operator: root
lp: root
root: ataylor

here the postmaster, operator, and lp usersâ€™ e-mail all redirect to the root user, whose mail in turn is 
redirected to the user ataylor.

You can direct mail for one user to more than one subsequent user as well.
