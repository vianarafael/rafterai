After nmap is installed (yum install nmap), use your system hostname or IP address to 
use nmap to scan your system to see what is running on common ports:

# nmap 192.168.0.119
Starting Nmap 5.21 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2012-06-16 08:27 EDT
Nmap scan report for spike (192.168.0.119)

The preceding output shows that TCP ports are open to the regular (http) and secure 
(https) web services.
