While rare, some hardware components (e.g., some wireless network cards) lack 
drivers and support on some or all Linux platforms.

You should confirm that whatever hardware you purchase is supported by the distribution you have 
selected. Most distributions have Hardware Compatibility Lists (HCLs) you can use to verify your hardware 
is supported.
