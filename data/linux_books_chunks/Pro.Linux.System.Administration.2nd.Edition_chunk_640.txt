You can also 
search for more than one file by using the asterisk symbol, as we have demonstrated for other commands 
earlier in this chapter, for example:

$ grep localhost /etc/host*
$ grep localhost /etc/*

The first command would search all files starting with host* in the /etc/ directory, and the second 

would search all files in the /etc/ directory.
