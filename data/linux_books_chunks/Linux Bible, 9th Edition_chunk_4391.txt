Notice that a few of the control ﬂ ags need to be carefully placed within 
the conﬁ guration ﬁ le’s stack. Some control ﬂ ags cause the authentication process to stop 
 immediately and the rest of the PAM modules are not called. The control ﬂ ags simply 
 control how the PAM module status results are combined into a single overall result.
