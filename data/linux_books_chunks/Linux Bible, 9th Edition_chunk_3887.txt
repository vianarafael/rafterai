Running apt-get upgrade causes the system to upgrade any 
installed packages that have new versions available, based on the latest downloaded metadata.

In contrast, every time you run a yum command in Fedora or RHEL, the latest metadata about new packages is 
downloaded. When you then run yum update, you get the latest packages available for the current release of 
Fedora or RHEL.
