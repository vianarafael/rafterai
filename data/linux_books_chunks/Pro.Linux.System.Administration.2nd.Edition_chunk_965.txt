If you execute the last command without any 
options, it will print a report of the last logins to the host.

$ sudo last
root       tty1                          Sat  Jul   3 12:32   still logged in
ataylor    pts/0         192.168.0.23    Sat  Jul   3 14:25 - 14:26  (00:01)
reboot     system boot   2.4.20-28.8     Sat  Jul   3 12:31         (4+05:40)

as you can see, the last command tells you that root is logged on and is still logged in.
