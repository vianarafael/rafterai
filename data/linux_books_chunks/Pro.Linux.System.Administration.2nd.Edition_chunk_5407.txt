You may also have these 
notifications being replicated to the syslog (rsyslog) daemon.

If you do not want this functionality, you can set your use_syslog directive to the following:

use_syslog=0

When you need to debug Nagios, you will need to edit the /etc/nagios/nagios.cfg file and edit the 

following:

debug_level=0

Do you remember from LDAP logging when we had additive logging directives that give different log 

levels by adding binary numbers together? Nagios is the same.
