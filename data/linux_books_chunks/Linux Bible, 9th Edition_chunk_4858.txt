With that setup in place, you can simply 
boot a computer from a network interface and come back a short time later to ﬁ nd a fully 
installed Linux system.

After a computer is deployed, systems can be conﬁ gured and possibly monitored and 
updated, using tools such as Puppet (http://puppetlabs.com) and Chef (www.chef
.io).
