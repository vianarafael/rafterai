Copyright was the primary means AT&T used to protect its rights 
to the UNIX code. Some believe that if AT&T had patented the concepts covered in that 
code, there might not be a Linux (or any UNIX clone) operating system today.

The lawsuit was dropped when Novell bought UNIX System Laboratories from AT&T in 1994.
