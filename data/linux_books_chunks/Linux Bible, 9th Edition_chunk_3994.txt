Remember, writing to disk is much slower than writing to RAM.

 ■ When data is returned from swap to RAM because it is needed again (swapped in), 

you get another performance hit.

 ■ When Linux runs out of space in RAM, swapping is like being wounded in battle. 
It’s not something you aspire to, but it’s better than being killed.
