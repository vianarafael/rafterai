The systemd-journal-remote user will 

need to be able to read the private key file. Next we need to make some additional filesystem changes.

$ sudo mkdir â€“p /var/log/journal/remote && sudo chown systemd-journal-remote /var/log/
journal/remote

By default the remote journal service will listen on port 19532.
