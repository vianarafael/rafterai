For example, to push a DNS server IP address to the client, we 
do the following:

push "dhcp-option DNS 10.0.2.155"

Here we’re telling OpenVPN to tell a Microsoft Windows client to push the DNS server 10.0.2.155 to its 

DHCP option.

In a Microsoft Windows environment, we can also push down a variety of other options, as shown in 

Table 15-1.
