Save the zone file and exit.

Next we need to thaw the zone again.

$ sudo rndc thaw example.com

And lastly letâ€™s validate that the change has worked with the dig command.

$ dig -t MX example.com @192.168.0.1
;; ANSWER SECTION:
example.com. 86400 IN MX 10 mail.example.com. 

That looks like we expect it to.
