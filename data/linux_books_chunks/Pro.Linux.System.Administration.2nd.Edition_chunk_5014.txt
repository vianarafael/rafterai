To make it active immediately, you 

can remount the filesystem using the mount command.

$ sudo mount -o remount,relatime /

In addition to mount options, filesystems themselves provide some features that may improve 
performance; these vary depending on what a particular file system is used for. The main one of these 
is dir_index, and it applies to the ext2, ext3, and ext4 file systems.
