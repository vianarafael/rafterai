Monitor Processes and generate alerts

This objective gives us the opportunity to use bash's control flow capabilities to make 
decisions when checking for the status of a given process.

Say we want to check that the smbd daemon is running, then restart it and send a message 
if it is stoped and do nothing if it is still running.
