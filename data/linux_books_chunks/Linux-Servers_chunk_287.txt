The last field (amount) is the multiplication
of the two fields named unitprice and unitcount.

mysql> create table invoices (
    -> id char(8) NOT NULL,
    -> customerid char(3) NOT NULL,
    -> unitprice int,
    -> unitcount smallint,
    -> amount int );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

We can let mysql do the calculation for that by using a before trigger.
