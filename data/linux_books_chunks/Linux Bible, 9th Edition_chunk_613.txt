Linux also keeps track of your 
login session: It knows when you logged in, how long you have been idle, and where you 
logged in from.

To Ô¨Å nd out information about your identity, use the id command as follows:

$ id
uid=501(chris) gid=501(chris) groups=105(sales), 7(lp)

In this example, the username is chris, which is represented by the numeric user ID (uid) 
501.
