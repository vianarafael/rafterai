This check_command is slightly different; after 
the command we want to use, you can see a string.

!20%!10%!/

This string consists of variables weâ€™re passing to the command definition, with each variable value 
prefixed with an exclamation mark (!). So here we are passing the values 20%, 10%, and / to the command.
