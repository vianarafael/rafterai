Here’s an example:

# mkdir /mnt/mycdimage
# mount -o loop whatever-i686-disc1.iso /mnt/mycdimage

In this example, the /mnt/mycdimage directory is created, and then the disk image ﬁ le 
(whatever-i686-disc1.iso) residing in the current directory is mounted on it. You can 
now cd to that directory, view the contents of it, and copy or use any of its contents.
