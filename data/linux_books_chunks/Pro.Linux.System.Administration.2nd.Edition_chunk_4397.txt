We’ve also added the auth-user-pass option, which 
tells the client that we’re going to use usernames and passwords rather than just certificate authentication.
Now, if we start OpenVPN on our client, it will connect to the gateway, prompting the user to enter 

appropriate credentials.

$ sudo /etc/init.d/openvpn restart
Shutting down openvpn                                      [ OK ]
Starting openvpn:
Enter Auth Username:jsmith
Enter Auth Password:********

Notice the auth username and password prompts.
