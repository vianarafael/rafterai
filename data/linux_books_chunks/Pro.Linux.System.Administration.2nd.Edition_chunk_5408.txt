Here is the list of possible logging levels:

#          -1 = Everything
#          0 = Nothing
#          1 = Functions
#          2 = Configuration
#          4 = Process information
#          8 = Scheduled events
#          16 = Host/service checks
#          32 = Notifications
#          64 = Event broker
#          128 = External commands
#          256 = Commands
#          512 = Scheduled downtime
#          1024 = Comments
#          2048 = Macros

So if we wanted to see host and service checks in our logs and the external commands, we would 

change debug=0 to debug=144, which is 16 (host/service checks) + 128 (external commands).
