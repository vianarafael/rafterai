Authenticated contacts are authenticated users, with the 
username of each matching the name of a Nagios contact.

Hence, if the username jsmith, for example, matches the name of a contact, which is the value of the 

contact_name directive, this authenticated user becomes an authenticated contact.

So, whatâ€™s the difference? Authenticated users are granted some generic rights to view the web console.
