example: DNS delegation

We have another Linux server named debian7b and we want to make it responsible for the
child domain test42.paul.local.

Note  the  name  of  the  servers  in  the  screenshots  are  either  debian7  (hosting  the  parent
domain) or debian7b (hosting the child domain).

We start by adjusting the /etc/bind/named.comf.local file (on the server hosting the parent
domain) to make sure that no forwarder will be used when resolving authoritative names.

root@debian7:~# grep -A4 paul.local /etc/bind/named.conf.local
zone "paul.local" IN {
        type master;
        file "/etc/bind/db.paul.local";
        allow-update { none; };
        allow-transfer { 10.104.15.20; };
        forwarders { };
};
root@debian7:~#

Technically, you could also set allow-transfer to { any; }; while troubleshooting and then
refine it later, but this is not needed for delegation.

Then we add the delegation to our zone database:

root@debian7:~# tail -3 /etc/bind/db.paul.local
$ORIGIN test42.paul.local.
@       IN      NS      ns2.test42.paul.local.
ns2     IN      A       10.104.33.31    ; the glue record
root@debian7:~#

Don't forget to restart bind and verify /var/log/syslog.

root@debian7:~# service bind9 restart
Stopping domain name service...: bind9.
Starting domain name service...: bind9.
root@debian7:~# grep paul.local /var/log/syslog | cut -c28- | tail -2
named[3202]: zone paul.local/IN: loaded serial 2014100801
named[3202]: zone paul.local/IN: sending notifies (serial 2014100801)
root@debian7:~#

Note that on your terminal you can type tail -40 /var/log/syslog because the only reason I
use grep, cut and tail -2 is to limit the size of the screenshots in this book.

Next we create a zone database file on the second server, as seen in this screenshot:

root@debian7b:~# cat /etc/bind/db.test42.paul.local
; child zone for classroom teaching
$TTL    86400
$ORIGIN test42.paul.local.
@       IN      SOA     ns2.test42.paul.local.
