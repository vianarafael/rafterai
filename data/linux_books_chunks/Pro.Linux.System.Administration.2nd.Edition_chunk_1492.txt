A /etc/resolv.conf file looks as follows:

$ sudo cat /etc/resolv.conf
; generated by /sbin/dhclient-script
search example.com
nameserver 192.168.0.1
nameserver  192.168.0.254

First you can see that the resolv.conf file was generated by the DHCP client. In general, this file should 

not need to be edited; often it will be overwritten by the NetworkManager.
