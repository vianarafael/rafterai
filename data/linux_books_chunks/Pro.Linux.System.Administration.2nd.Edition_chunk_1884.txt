You can view such scripts with the following:

# rpm â€“q --scripts bash
postinstall scriptlet (using <lua>):
nl        = '\n'
sh        = '/bin/sh'..nl
bash      = '/bin/bash'..nl
f = io.open('/etc/shells', 'a+')
if f then
  local shells = nl..f:read('*all')..nl
  if not shells:find(nl..sh) then f:write(sh) end
  if not shells:find(nl..bash) then f:write(bash) end
  f:close()
end

In the above Lua script (Lua is a programming language) we can see the script that gets executed 
after we install the bash program.
