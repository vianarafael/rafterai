Upgrades generally do more checking and 
 comparing than clean installs do, so any package you can remove saves time 
during the upgrade process.

 ■ Check configuration files. A Linux upgrade procedure often leaves copies of 
old conﬁ guration ﬁ les. You should check that the new conﬁ guration ﬁ les still 
work for you.

Installing Linux from scratch goes faster than an upgrade.
