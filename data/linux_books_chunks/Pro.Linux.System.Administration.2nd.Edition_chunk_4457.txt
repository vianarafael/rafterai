By default, OpenLDAP uses the Memory Mapped Database 

(MDB), which is based on the Lightning Memory Mapped Database (LMDB). The LMDB was developed 
by Symas, a software organization founded by many, if not all, the core OpenLDAP development team. 
It is extremely fast and scalable, with databases holding millions of records. It is optimized for reading, 
searching, and browsing.
