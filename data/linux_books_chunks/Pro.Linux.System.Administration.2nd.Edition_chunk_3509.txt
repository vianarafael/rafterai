Letâ€™s start the clamd service.

$ sudo systemctl enable clamd@scan && sudo systemctl start clamd@scan (CentOS)
$ sudo systemctl enable clamav-daemon && sudo systemctl start clamav-daemon (Ubuntu)

Next we will start the clamav-milter service and freshclamd service, which polls for the latest virus 

signature updates.

$ sudo systemctl enable clamav-milter && sudo systemctl start clamav-milter (Both)
$ sudo systemctl enable clamav-freshclam && sudo systemctl start clamav-freshclam (Ubuntu)

We should now be able to look a bit more at the configuration of ClamAV.
