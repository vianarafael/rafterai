(/mnt is a common place to 
put temporarily mounted disks and NFS ﬁ lesystems.) The mount command identiﬁ es the 
remote computer and shared ﬁ lesystem, separated by a colon (maple:/stuff), and the 
local mount point directory (/mnt/maple) follows.

If the mount fails, make sure the NFS service is running on the server and that the server’s fi rewall rules don’t deny 
access to the service.
