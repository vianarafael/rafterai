You can use the tune2fs utility to check whether it’s enabled.

$sudo tune2fs -l /dev/md0 | grep features
Filesystem features: has_journal ext_attr resize_inode dir_index filetype needs_recovery 
extent 64bit flex_bg 
    sparse_super large_file huge_file uninit_bg dir_nlink extra_isize

If you need to change features, and you rarely do, you could use tune2fs to enable a particular feature.

sudo tune2fs -O dir_index /dev/md0

Alternatively, features can be turned off by prefixing their name with a caret.

sudo tune2fs -O ^dir_index /dev/md0

You can set which options should be enabled on the various ext file systems by changing the defaults in 

the /etc/mke2fs.conf file.
