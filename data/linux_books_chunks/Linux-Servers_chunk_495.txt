iptables tables

By default there are three tables in the kernel that contain sets of rules.

The filter table is used for packet filtering.

root@debian6~# iptables -t filter -L
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

The nat table is used for address translation.

root@debian6~# iptables -t nat -L
Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

Chain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

The mangle table can be used for special-purpose processing of packets.

Series of rules in each table are called a chain.
