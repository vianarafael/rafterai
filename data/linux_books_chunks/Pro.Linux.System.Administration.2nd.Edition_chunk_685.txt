Let’s look at an example.

$ cat *.txt | sort | uniq > text

140

ChapTeR 4 ■ LInux BasICs

In this example we’ve asked the host to output all files with a suffix of .txt, sort them alphabetically, 
delete duplicate lines (using the uniq command), and then output the result to a file called text (which 
would be created if not present and overwritten if present).

You can also redirect input as well as output.

$ grep accounts < /etc/group > matched_accounts

In the previous example, we’ve directed the file /etc/group into the grep command using the < 
symbol.
