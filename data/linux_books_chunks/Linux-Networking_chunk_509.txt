To resolve
names, computers had a flat file that contained a table to resolve hostnames to ip addresses.
This local file was downloaded from hosts.txt on an ftp server in Stanford.

In 1984 Paul Mockapetris created dns, a distributed treelike hierarchical database that will
be explained in detail in these chapters.

Today,  dns  or  domain  name  system  is  a  worldwide  distributed  hierarchical  database
controlled by ICANN.
