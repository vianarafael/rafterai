The following is an example of creating a 
restricted deletion directory with a Ô¨Å le that is wide open for writing by anyone:

[mary]$ mkdir /tmp/mystuff
[mary]$ chmod 1777 /tmp/mystuff
[mary]$ cp /etc/services /tmp/mystuff/
[mary]$ chmod 666 /tmp/mystuff/services
[mary]$ ls -ld /tmp/mystuff /tmp/mystuff/services
drwxrwxrwt. 2 mary mary   4096 Jan 22 15:28 /tmp/mystuff/
-rw-rw-rw-.
