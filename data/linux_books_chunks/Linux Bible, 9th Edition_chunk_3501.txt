This makes it easy to debug problems associated with 
requests from a particular system because each client is assigned its own log ﬁ le.

The max log size limits the size of each log ﬁ le to a set number of kilobytes (50KB by 
default). After that size is exceeded, Samba copies the ﬁ le to a log ﬁ le of the same name 
with a .old appended to it.
