The 
one you choose determines whether the customizations take effect and if they remain per-
sistent through software upgrades.

You can place your system service conﬁ guration unit ﬁ le in one of the following two 
locations:

 ■ /etc/systemd/system

 ■ This location is used to store customized local service conﬁ guration unit ﬁ les.

 ■ Files in this location are not overwritten by software installations or upgrades.

Files here are used by the system even if there is a ﬁ le of the same name in the /lib/
systemd/system directory.

 ■ /lib/systemd/system

 ■ This location is used to store system service conﬁ guration unit ﬁ les.

 ■ Files in this location are overwritten by software installations and upgrades.

Files here are used by the system only if there is not a ﬁ le of the same name in the /etc/
systemd/system directory.

Thus, the best place to store your new or customized service conﬁ guration unit ﬁ le is in
/etc/systemd/system.

When you create a new or customized service, in order for the change to take effect without a server reboot, you need 
to issue a special command.
