My friend Richard said he has 
seen students who installed Skype on Linux in a way that causes Skype to use TCP port 80 
when running in the background.

Chapter 17: Confi guring a Web Server

You can use the netstat command to view the list of programs (including Apache) with 
TCP ports in the LISTEN state:

# netstat -nltp
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto  Local Address  Foreign Address  State   PID/Program name
tcp6   :::80          :::*             LISTEN  2105/httpd

The output from netstat (which was shortened to Ô¨Å t here) indicates that an instance of 
the httpd process with a process ID of 2105 is listening (as indicated by the LISTEN state) 
for connections to any local IP address (indicated by :::80) on port 80 (the standard HTTP 
port).
