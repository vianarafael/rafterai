In the previous example, 
Muttrc and Muttrc.local were found with -i whereas they weren’t found without 
that option.

$ locate services
/etc/services
/usr/share/services/bmp.kmgio
/usr/share/services/data.kmgio

Unlike the find command, which uses the -name option to ﬁ nd ﬁ lenames, the locate 
command locates the string you enter if it exists in any part of the ﬁ le’s path.
