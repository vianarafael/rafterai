Any packets 
with any protocol will now be sent to chain IPV4-INCOMING, as denoted by -j IPV4-INCOMING, for further 
processing.

We may not want all our packets to go to our IPV4-INCOMING chain. Maybe we only want tcp packets 

to go to that chain and we will handle udp packets in a different chain. You can refine what you want to catch 
in your rules by adding other parameters.
