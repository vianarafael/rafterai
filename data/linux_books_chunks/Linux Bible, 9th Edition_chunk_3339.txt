The ﬁ rst allows anonymous users to 
upload ﬁ les; the second allows them to create directories:

anon_upload_enable=YES
anon_mkdir_write_enable=YES

The next step is to create a directory where anonymous users can write. Any directory 
under the /var/ftp directory that has write permissions for the user ftp, the ftp group, 
or other can be written to by an anonymous user.
