We are able to 

access anything that the firewall on the gateway host allows us to on the 192.168.0.0/24 network.

If the branch1 host is the default route for 192.168.10.0/24 (the local network at the branch1 site), then 
all our users in the 192.162.10.0/24 network will be able to access resources in the 192.168.0.0/24 network at 
our head office.

 we’re not going to tell our head office how to route to the internal networks of our branch offices, but 

 ■ Note 
this is also possible.

Firewall

We also need to ensure the firewall rules on our gateway and branch hosts allow traffic to and from the 
relevant networks.
