Many of the special 
 requirements require you to make a change to PAM system event conﬁ guration ﬁ les, such 
as /etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac.

The problem with making changes to some of these PAM system event conﬁ guration ﬁ les is 
that the utility authconfig can rewrite these ﬁ les and remove any locally made changes.
