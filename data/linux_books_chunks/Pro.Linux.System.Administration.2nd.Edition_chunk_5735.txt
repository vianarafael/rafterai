There are many core modules shipped with Ansible, and they are documented here: http://
docs.ansible.com/ansible/modules_by_category.html.

The target systems, or inventory, are a collection of hosts and can be grouped together into groups. 
These can be static or dynamically collected with helper scripts. You can assign variables to these hosts and 
groups that can be used in your playbooks.
