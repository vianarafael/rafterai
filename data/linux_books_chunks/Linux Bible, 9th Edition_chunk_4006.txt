Thatâ€™s because the VIRT column shows 
only the amount of memory that has been promised to the application. The RES line 
shows the amount of nonswappable memory that is actually being used, which totals 
only 1364MB.

Notice that, when you ask to sort by memory usage by typing a capital M, top knows to 
sort on that RES column.
