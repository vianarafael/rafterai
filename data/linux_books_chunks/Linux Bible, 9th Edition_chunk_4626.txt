The example that follows shows the ausearch 
command being used to review the logged AVC denial message.

# ausearch -m avc
type=AVC msg=audit(1411184014.986:69860): avc: denied { create } for
  pid=21875 comm="vsftpd" name="services" 
  scontext=system_u:system_r:ftpd_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 
  tcontext=system_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 tclass=file

The display provides information on who was attempting access, along with his security 
context when attempting it.
