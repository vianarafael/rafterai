After the reboot, the disk previously known as /dev/sdc is now /dev/sdb.

[root@RHEL5 ~]# tune2fs -l /dev/sdb1 | grep UUID
Filesystem UUID:          7626d73a-2bb6-4937-90ca-e451025d64e8

And thanks to the uuid in /etc/fstab, the mountpoint is mounted on the same disk as before.

[root@RHEL5 ~]# df -h | grep sdb
/dev/sdb1             397M   11M  366M   3% /home/pro42
