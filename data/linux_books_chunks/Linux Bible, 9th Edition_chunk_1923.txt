Here’s an example 
of a find command that ﬁ nds all ﬁ les in the ﬁ lesystem that are not associated with any 
user (the ﬁ les are listed by UID):

# find / -nouser -ls

Understanding Group Accounts
Group accounts are useful if you want to share a set of ﬁ les with multiple users. You 
can create a group and change the set of ﬁ les to be associated with that group.
