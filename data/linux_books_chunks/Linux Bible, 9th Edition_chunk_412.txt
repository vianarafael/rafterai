Use multiple workspaces. Move the mouse to the upper-left corner again 

to show a minimized view of all windows. Notice all the applications on the 
right jammed into a small representation of one workspace while an additional 
 workspace is empty. Drag and drop a few of the windows to an empty desktop 
space. Figure 2.5 shows what the small workspaces look like.
