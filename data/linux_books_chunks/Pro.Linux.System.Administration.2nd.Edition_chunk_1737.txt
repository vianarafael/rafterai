For example, for our example network, we will allow network 

services by setting the following:

ALL: localhost ACCEPT
sshd: .example.com EXCEPT .baddomain.com

These settings will first allow any localhost connections to be accepted. Many services require 

connections to services running on the loopback (localhost) interface, and these need to be accepted.
