Because some older browsers canâ€™t support SNI, you can still see IP-based virtual hosting

Name-based virtual hosting causes Apache to serve a web page for a specific directory based on the 
name of the site a remote user connected to. Any number of name-based virtual hosts can share a single IP 
address.
