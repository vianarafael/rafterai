These certificates are issued by a certificate authority 
that you create and manage yourself. As a result, the certificates don’t cost any money, but they do have 
other issues. First, as it is your own CA, you can’t expect others to trust your certificates. This leads us to the 
second issue: usability. The root certificate of your CA is not bundled with clients and will never be.
