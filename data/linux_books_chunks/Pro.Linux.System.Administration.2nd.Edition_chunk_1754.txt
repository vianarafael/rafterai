Ubuntu has 
appended the following information to the end of our /etc/ppp/peers/dsl-provider file:

# Minimalistic default options file for DSL/PPPoE connections
noipdefault
defaultroute
replacedefaultroute
hide-password
#lcp-echo-interval 30
#lcp-echo-failure 4
noauth
persist
#mtu 1492
#persist
#maxfail 0
#holdoff 20
plugin rp-pppoe.so
nic-enp0s8
user "username"

The password information is stored here, in the /etc/ppp/chap-secrets file, and the contents are 

much like Listing 7-10.

If you are are not successful you can view connection logs via the plog command on Ubuntu or /var/

log/messages on CentOS.

out the right interface.

$ ip route show
default via 10.1.1.1 dev adsl-enp0s8

In the above example, 10.1.1.1 would be your ISPs first hop and traffic will go out the adsl-enp0s8 

interface if it is destined to leave your network.
