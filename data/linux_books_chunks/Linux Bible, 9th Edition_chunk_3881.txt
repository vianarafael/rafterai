If you use the main Fedora repositories to install software from the current 
release, it is rare to have dependency problems.

When packages are added to the repository, as long as the repository maintain-
ers run the right commands to set up the repository (and you donâ€™t use outside 
repositories), everything you need to install a selected package should be available.
