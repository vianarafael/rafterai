For example, consider the following:

$ sudo passwd –l ataylor

The previous command would lock the ataylor user and prevent ataylor from logging into the host 

using her password. You can then unlock the user using the –u, or unlock, option.

$ sudo passwd –u ataylor

However, this command doesn’t fully disable access to the host.
