Advantages of IMAP:

•	

•	

•	

Allows users to access e-mail from multiple locations, not just their client

Allows webmail access

Protects your messages from accidental deletion

•	 Centralizes e-mail, making backup and recovery easier

Advantages of POP3:

•	

•	

You don’t need to be connected to the server (or indeed the network) to have access 
to your e-mail.

It doesn’t use any storage on your server—all mail is stored on your clients after 
retrieval.

Disadvantages of IMAP:

•	

•	

You need to be able to connect to the server (and hence the network and/or Internet) 
to access your e-mail.

It requires sufficient storage on your server.

Disadvantages of POP3:

•	 Mail is present only on the client and can’t be accessed from elsewhere.

•	 Users can lose e-mail if they lose, damage, or rebuild their client desktop, laptop, and 

so on, without sufficient backups.

•	

If users require e-mail to be backed up, a per-client backup and recovery strategy can 
be complex and difficult to implement.

Choosing Between IMAP and POP3
For the vast majority of circumstances, we recommend you use IMAP.
