The non-graphical
way is to use rpm or yum.

When you downloaded the .rpm file, you can install Samba like this.

[paul@RHEL52 ~]$ rpm -i samba-3.0.28-1.el5_2.1.rpm

When you have a subscription to RHN (Red Hat Network), then yum is an easy tool to use.
This yum command works by default on Fedora and CentOS.

[root@centos6 ~]# yum install samba
