To Ô¨Å nd out the name of an RPM package currently installed on your system 
(such as the Firefox web browser), you could type the following from the shell in Fedora or 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux:

# rpm -q firefox
firefox-24.7.0-1.el7_0.x86_64

From this, you can tell that the basename of the package is firefox.
