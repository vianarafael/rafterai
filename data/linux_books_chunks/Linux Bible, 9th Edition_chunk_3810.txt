The messages appear 
as components are detected, such as your CPU, memory, network cards, hard drives, and so on.

In Linux systems that support systemd, kernel messages are stored in the systemd 
 journal. So instead of using the dmesg command, you can run journalctl to see kernel 
messages from boot time to the present.
