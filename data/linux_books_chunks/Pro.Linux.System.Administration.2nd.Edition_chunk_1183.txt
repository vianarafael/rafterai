When your system has started you can move between these targets by 
issuing the following command:

$ sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target

What this command will do look at the graphical.target unit file, determine if it has AllowIsolate=yes, 
then execute the Requires, Conflicts, After, Wants and other directives to bring the system to that “state.” You 
will notice when you look at the graphical.target unit file (found in /lib/systemd/system directory) that it 
Requires the multiuser target and should not start until After it is completed.
