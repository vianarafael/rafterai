The main RSpec web site is here: 
http://rspec.info/.

If you donâ€™t like to install Ruby and RSpec, you can use this alternative Python-based framework, 
which is designed to be the Python equivalent of Serverspec; see https://testinfra.readthedocs.io/en/
latest/. If you were using Ansible, then this might be the better option for you.
