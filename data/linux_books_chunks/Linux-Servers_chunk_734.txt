query a user

We can use wbinfo -a to verify authentication of a user against Active Directory. Assuming
a user account harry with password stargate is just created on the Active Directory, we get
the following screenshot.

[root@RHEL52 ~]# wbinfo -a harry%stargate
plaintext password authentication succeeded
challenge/response password authentication succeeded
