For more information, you can look at the documentation provided by the iputils 
package that manages bonding on CentOS hosts, specifically the /usr/share/doc/iputils-<version>/
README.bonding.

What happens when you interface comes up is that your scripts (NetworkManager or ifup-eth scripts) 

will insert the bonding module into the kernel.
