It is worth noting that in 
these sections you can see a semicolon on the Requires and Alias options. If lines start with a #or a;then they 
are considered comments and are ignored. In Listing 6-8 we see that there is a [Service] section and we use 
that to describe the service we are configuring to run on our system.

All [Service] sections require a Type option.
