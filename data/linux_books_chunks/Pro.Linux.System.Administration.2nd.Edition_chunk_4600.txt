We 
will explain ssf further in the “Securing SLAPD with TLS” section of this chapter, but for now, the tls_ssf 
specifies the minimum TLS key size required to access these attributes, meaning we will allow access to 
these attributes only if they have an adequately secured transport layer.

 We will explain security strength factors shortly.
