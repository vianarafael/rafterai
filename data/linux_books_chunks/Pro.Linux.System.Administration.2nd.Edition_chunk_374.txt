Vagrantfile—Adding aBox

Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
 config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
end

In Listing 3-5 we are setting the config.vm.box to ubuntu/xenial64.

 ■ Note 
 the box listed here is a 64-bit operating system release (ubuntu/xenial64). depending on the 
system you are working on, you might only have a 32-bit operating system.
