The N stands for “Nonexistent” and indicates the 
server was freshly booted to the current runlevel.

$ runlevel
N 5

15

How does the server know which services to stop and which ones to start when a  particular 
runlevel is chosen? When a runlevel is chosen, the scripts located in the /etc/rc.d/rc#.d 
directory (where # is the chosen runlevel) are run.
