Take a look at the following line:

to dn.subtree="ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" attrs="userPassword"
   by dn.exact="cn=admin,ou=meta,dc=example,dc=com" write
   by * none

In this example, we have declared we would like this to apply to everything under and including 
ou=people,dc=example,dc=com and to any attribute called userPassword that might be found under 
there.
