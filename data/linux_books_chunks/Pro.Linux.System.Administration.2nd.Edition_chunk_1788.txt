In this section, we’re going to focus on the tools provided as part of 
CentOS, but the information contained within will also help with other Red Hat–based distributions like Red 
Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Fedora, and Mandriva.

In the sections that follow, we’ll take you through package installation via the GUI interface and the 

command line, and how to use the rpm tool itself to manage individual packages.

Getting Started
On Red Hat–based hosts like CentOS, Scientific Linux, and Fedora, managing your packages via the desktop 
is simple and does not require a subscription.

However, for RHEL hosts, you will need to have a subscription to get access to software updates and Red 
Hat’s services.
