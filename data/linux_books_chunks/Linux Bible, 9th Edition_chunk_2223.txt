Unlike desktop systems, which can  simply 
close down all network ports that allow incoming requests for access, a server 
must make itself vulnerable by allowing some access to its ports. Thatâ€™s why it is 
important as a server administrator to open ports to services that are needed and 
lock down ports that are not needed.
