The htpasswd command can create a .htpasswd file that contains a userid
and an (encrypted) password.

This screenshot creates a user and password for the hacker named cliff and uses the -c flag
to create the .htpasswd file.

[root@CentOS65 ~]# htpasswd -c /var/www/.htpasswd cliff
New password: 
Re-type new password: 
Adding password for user cliff
[root@CentOS65 ~]# cat /var/www/.htpasswd
cliff:QNwTrymMLBctU

Hacker rob also wants access, this screenshot shows how to add a second user and password
to .htpasswd.

[root@CentOS65 ~]# htpasswd /var/www/.htpasswd rob
New password: 
Re-type new password: 
Adding password for user rob
[root@CentOS65 ~]# cat /var/www/.htpasswd
cliff:QNwTrymMLBctU
rob:EC2vOCcrMXDoM
[root@CentOS65 ~]#

Both  Cliff  and  Rob  chose  the  same  password  (hunter2),  but  that  is  not  visible  in  the
.htpasswd file because of the different salts.

Next we need to create a .htaccess file in the DocumentRoot of the website we want to
protect.
