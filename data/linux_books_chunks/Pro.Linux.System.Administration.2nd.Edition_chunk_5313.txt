First, we define what sort of object this 

is a template for, in our case a host object. Next, using the name attribute, we give our template a name that 
must be unique. You can’t have two templates named linux-server.

The next attribute is one you’ve seen before, use, and it allows us to specify a template that this template 

in turn inherits from.
