you can look at using groups to achieve this.

Lines 22â€“28 are a Bash function that handles our error checking. If the script ends in anything other 
than a zero, then it fails; if it ends in zero, the script is successful. The error_check() subroutine or function 
takes the $? argument, the exit code from another function call, and tests it for a zero.
