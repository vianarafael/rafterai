We will need to set the following:

GPG_PW='mygeniusbigbikeisnice'

First we have provided the GPG_PW value. This is the password we will use to encrypt and decrypt 
our backups. You can use a more random password than this simple example. You should copy it to your 
password safe or manager for future reference.
