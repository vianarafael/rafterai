If you have a standard PC (32-bit or 64-bit) with a CD/DVD drive 
and at least 1GB of memory (RAM) and at least a 400-MHz processor, you are 
ready to start. (Just make sure the image you download matches your computer’s 
 architecture—a 64-bit medium does not run on a 32-bit computer.)

2.  Start the live CD/DVD. Insert the live CD/DVD or USB drive into your computer and 
reboot your computer.
