When you expand an environment variable on a command line, the value of 
the variable is printed instead of the variable name itself, as follows:

$ ls -l $BASH
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root  root  1012808 Oct  8 08:53 /bin/bash

Using $BASH as an argument to ls -l causes a long listing of the bash command to 
be printed.

Using Shell Variables
The shell itself stores information that may be useful to the userâ€™s shell session in what are 
called variables.
