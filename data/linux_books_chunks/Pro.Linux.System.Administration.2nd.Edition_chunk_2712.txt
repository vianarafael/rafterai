If you don’t want to see this output, you can 

use the –q option.

We are going to add key “dynamic-update-key” to our /etc/bind/named.conf.options file.

key "dynamic-update-key" {
     algorithm hmac-sha512;
     secret "kHATLZ8hl4RbSoe7W71pqaGZ3oCIP3WIgZZI/UcXYzbOooCOTS3cN7lFdQ/+97VYVfFYEGmzRCqRKy
j4AcLfdg==";
};

Next we need to add the update-policy to the zone definition for the example.com zone file.

zone "example.com" {
    type master;
    file "master/example.com.db";
    notify yes;
    allow-transfer {
      transfer-hosts ;
    };
    update-policy {
      grant dynamic-update-key zonesub ANY;
    };
    key-directory "/etc/bind/keys";
    auto-dnssec maintain;
    inline-signing yes;
};

We then reload the name server configuration via sudo rndc reload.

 ■ Tip  You can also use key-based authentication between master and slave Dns servers.

Configuring DHCP

The next step is to tell the DHCP server about this key as well, and to configure it so it sends DNS update 
requests to named when it hands out a new lease.
