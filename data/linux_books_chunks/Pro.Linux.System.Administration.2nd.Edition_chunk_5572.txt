Then we enable NTP for our clocks and set their 
time to UTC.

Managing Users

With Cobbler and Preseed we enable the root user, which Ubuntu doesnâ€™t normally do.

d-i passwd/root-login boolean true
d-i passwd/root-password-crypted password $default_password_crypted
d-i passwd/make-user boolean false

So when you build your hosts, you will need to sign in as root.
