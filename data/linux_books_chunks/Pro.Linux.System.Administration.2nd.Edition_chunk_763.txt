You can also create an individual account on the command line using the following 
command:

$ sudo useradd â€“e 2016-09-15 temp_account

This command creates an account called temp_account that would be disabled on 09-15-2016.
You can change many of the default settings in this file by executing the useradd command with the -D 

option.
