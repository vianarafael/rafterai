We 
talked previously about the MBR and said that there was 446 bytes at the start of the disk before the partition 
table. This is where the first stage of the boot loader code for your operating system will be stored and the 
BIOS will attempt to execute the code it finds there. For Linux, this a file called boot.img.

When BIOS executes boot.img it finds and runs a file called core.img.
