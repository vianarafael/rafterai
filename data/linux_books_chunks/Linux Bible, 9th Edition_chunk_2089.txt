But if you 
decide you want to do that, edit /etc/fstab and add a line describing what and 
where to mount. Here is an example of a line you might add:

/dev/sdc1    /mnt/test      ext4    defaults    0 1

In this example, the partition (/dev/sdc1) is mounted on the /mnt/test 
 directory as an ext4 Ô¨Å lesystem. The defaults keyword causes the partition to be 
mounted at boot time.
