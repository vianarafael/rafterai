The Nagios console

Once we have users and passwords created, we can sign on to the console, but we also need to 
configure what access each user has. This is done by editing a configuration file called cgi.cfg, located in 
the /etc/nagios directory.

Nagios has two types of users on the console: authenticated users and authenticated contacts.
