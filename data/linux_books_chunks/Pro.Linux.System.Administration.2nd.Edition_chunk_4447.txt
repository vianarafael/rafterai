These logical groups are 

called organizational units and represented as ou. You can group whatever you like together, but the 
main organizational units you will normally see in your LDAP tree are People, Groups, and Machines. 
You store everything to do with your people under ou=people, your user groups under ou=groups, and 
your nonhuman assets under ou=Machines (also commonly named ou=hosts).
