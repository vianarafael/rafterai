Here are examples of how to 
immediately stop the smb and nmb services:

# systemctl stop smb.service
# systemctl stop nmb.service

In RHEL 6 and earlier, you would type the following to stop the smb and nmb services:

# service smb stop
# service nmb stop

To prevent the smb and nmb services from starting the next time the system reboots, type 
the following commands in Fedora or RHEL 7:

# systemctl disable smb.service
# systemctl disable nmb.service

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, type the following commands to disable the smb and 
nmb services:

# chkconfig smb off
# chkconfig nmb off

Of course, you only want to stop or disable the smb and nmb services if you no longer want 
to use the Samba service.
