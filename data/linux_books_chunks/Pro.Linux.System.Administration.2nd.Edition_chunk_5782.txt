It tells Ansible that the values in {{ }} are variables, either facts or 
like the ones we have just created.

Remembering back to when we ran the setup module with the ansible command, the output list from 

there contained the key values for ansible_distribution and ansible_distribution_major_version.

        "ansible_distribution": "CentOS",
        "ansible_distribution_major_version": "7",

On a CentOS system, when we run the play, the Jinja2 templating engines will substitute the variables 

like this:

VARIABLES AND CONDITIONALS

ansible and Jinja2 can be powerful.
