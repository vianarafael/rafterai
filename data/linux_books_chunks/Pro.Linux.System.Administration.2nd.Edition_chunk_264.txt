Most commonly this happens due to defective 
installation media; less often it happens due to unsupported or defective hardware.

If there is a problem with the installation media, you may see read errors being logged or the installer 

may display an error stating it was unable to read a file. You should check the installation CD or DVD for 
scratches.
