By default, ifconfig shows similar information to that of ip addr, but ifconfig also 
shows the number of packets received (RX) and transmitted (TX), as well as the amount of 
data and any errors or dropped packets:

# ifconfig wlan0
wlan0 Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:24:D7:69:5B:2C
      inet addr:192.168.0.105 Bcast:192.168.0.255 Mask:255.255.255.0
      inet6 addr: fe80::224:d7ff:fe69:5b2c/64 Scope:Link
      UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
      RX packets:22482 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:9699 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000
          RX bytes:9456897 (9.0 MiB)  TX bytes:1232234 (1.1 MiB)

Checking connectivity to remote systems
To make sure you can reach systems that are available on the network, you can use the ping 
command.
