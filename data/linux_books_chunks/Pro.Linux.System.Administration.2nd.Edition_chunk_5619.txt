In this directory, you will most likely see the following directories 
and files:

ll /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  879 Dec  5 23:53 environment.conf
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Dec  5 23:53 hieradata/
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Dec  5 23:53 manifests/
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Dec  5 23:53 modules/

There is an environment.conf file that the Puppet server will read to determine the specific settings this 

environment will need.
