For example, 
to recursively change the ﬁ le context of the /var/ftp/pub/stuff directory so the 
content can be readable from the FTP server through SELinux, type the following:

# semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_t "/var/ftp/pub/stuff(/.*)?"
# restorecon -F -R -v /var/ftp/pub/stuff

If you want to allow users to also write to a directory as well as read from it, you need to 
assign the public_content_rw_t ﬁ le context to the directory to which you want to 
allow uploads.
