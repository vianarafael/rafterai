We specified the command to be run when we use the key and the hosts that can connect with it, and 
we limited the functions normally allowed with general users. Anyone connecting with this key will now be 
able to run only the ssh_limiter.sh script, which allows only the rsync command to be executed and only 
connections originating from the *.example.com domain.
