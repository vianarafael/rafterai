To show the status of the cups daemon on your Linux server, use the following:

 ■ For SysVinit:

# service cups status
cupsd (pid 8236) is running...

 ■ For Upstart:

# initctl status cups
cups start/running, process 2390

 ■ Remember that if a service has not yet been ported to Upstart, you need to use 

the service command instead of initctl.

 ■ For systemd:

# systemctl status cups.service
cups.service - CUPS Printing Service
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/cups.service; enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Tue, 01 May 2015 04:43:5...
  Main PID: 17003 (cupsd)     
     CGroup: name=systemd:/system/cups.service
              17003 /usr/sbin/cupsd -f
