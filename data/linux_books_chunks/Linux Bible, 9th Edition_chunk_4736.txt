Consider the following example of a typical pair of hosts.allow and hosts.deny ﬁ les.

# cat /etc/hosts.allow
# hosts.allow This file describes the names of the hosts that are
#          allowed to use the local INET services, as decided
#          by the '/usr/sbin/tcpd' server.
#
sshd: 199.170.177.
vsftpd: ALL
#
# cat /etc/hosts.deny
# hosts.deny This file describes names of the hosts which are
#          *not* allowed to use the local INET services, as
#          decided by the '/usr/sbin/tcpd' server.
#
ALL: ALL

In the hosts ﬁ les, lines beginning with a # character are comments and are ignored.
