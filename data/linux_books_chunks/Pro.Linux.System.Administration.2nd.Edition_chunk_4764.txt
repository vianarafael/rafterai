There are two ways to do this; the first is with a bind DN and password, like a proxy, that will bind and get 
access to the entries, and the second is with anonymous bind, where no bind is done (remember that bind is 
another word for authentication). If we use a proxy bind DN, we need to set a password in clear text on every 
host that connects.
