If we see the perspective from jsmith, we 
can see that it too does not have access.

[jsmith@backup]
$ cp text.file /data/sales/
cp: cannot create regular file '/data/sales/text.file': Permission denied
[jsmith@backup ~]$ ll /data/
ls: cannot access /data/sales: Permission denied
total 20
d?????????? ? ?        ?         ?            ? sales

The user jsmith cannot even see the permissions on the /data/sales directory, which is the reason for 

????.
