We are going to be installing this service on our Ubuntu 
monitoring host via the APT repository provided at https://www.elastic.co, a company that helps design 
and support the open source projects of Kibana, Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Beats.

Let’s first add the APT repository by first adding the public GPG key, then adding the package  
apt-transport-https (if it is not already installed), and finally adding the actual repository to APT.

wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -
sudo aptitude install –y apt-transport-https
echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/5.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/
sources.list.d/elastic-5.x.list
sudo aptitude update

Here we have used the aptitude package manager, which we have installed rather than apt-get, which 

you can also use.
