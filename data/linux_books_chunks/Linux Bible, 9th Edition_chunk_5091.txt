Keep in mind that the latest Fedora Workstation ISO 
image does not Ô¨Å t on a CD, so you must burn it to DVD. See the descriptions of CD/DVD burn-
ing tools available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux later in this appendix.

Figure A.1 shows an example of the Get Fedora page.

Today, the default download is an ISO image of a 64-bit PC-type Fedora Workstation 
(GNOME) Live DVD.
