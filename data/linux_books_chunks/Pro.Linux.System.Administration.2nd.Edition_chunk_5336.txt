While checks occur during the check_period time, in our case the 24x7 period, notifications (the 
alerts that get generated when a status changes) will get sent only during the workhours time period.

define timeperiod{
          timeperiod_name      workhours
          alias                "Normal" Working Hours
          monday               09:00-17:00
          tuesday              09:00-17:00
          wednesday            09:00-17:00
          thursday             09:00-17:00
          Friday               09:00-17:00
          }

You can see that the workhours time period is 9 a.m.
