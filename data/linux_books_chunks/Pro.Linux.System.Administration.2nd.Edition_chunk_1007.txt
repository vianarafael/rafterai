Later in the section “Using the GRUB2 Menu,” we will explain these choices 
and how to manipulate them.

After picking the kernel you wish to boot into (or waiting until the default is loaded after the timeout), 

GRUB2 will now find the kernel binary (vmlinuz-<release-number>) and then load a special file called 
initrd.img into memory.
