Here’s an example that uses a few more options to do so:

# useradd -g users -G wheel,apache -s /bin/tcsh -c "Sara Green" sara

In this case, useradd is told to make users the primary group sara belongs to (-g), add her 
to the wheel and apache groups, and assign tcsh as her primary command shell (-s). A home 
directory in /home under the user’s name (/home/sara) is created by default.
