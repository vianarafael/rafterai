To ﬁ x the problem, you need 
to remount the root ﬁ lesystem, correct the fstab ﬁ le, mount the ﬁ lesystem entry 
to make sure it now works, and reboot. Here’s what that sequence of commands 
looks like:

# mount -o remount,rw /
# vim /etc/fstab
# mount -a
# reboot

The vim command is used particularly when editing the /etc/fstab fi le because it knows the format of that fi le.
