For example, you may want to install only supported and free packages from Canonical, in 
which case your sources line might look as follows:

deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial main

As an exercise, why not point your web browser to http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu and see how 
a repository is laid out?

You can find out more about repositories and sections and how to set them up at https://help.

performing the upgrade of packages that require upgrading on your host.

Listing 8-15 shows how to perform an update of the list of available packages.
