Querying Our Local Caching DNS Server

$ host www.google.com localhost
Using domain server:
Name: localhost
Address: 127.0.0.1#53
Aliases:

www.google.com has address 216.58.220.132
www.google.com has IPv6 address 2404:6800:4006:806::2004

We asked the DNS server running on localhost to look up the address for www.google.com and it 

responded, so it works!

With a working caching DNS, we can replace the nameserver entries in our /etc/resolv.conf file 

with nameserver 192.168.0.1 to use our own server.
