In this procedure, I use the Virtualization Manager 
window (virt-manager) to conﬁ gure the NFS storage pool.

For consistency’s sake, the NFS share set up from the storage system is the /var/lib/
libvirt/images directory. It is mounted in the same place on each of the hypervisors. 
(For testing, if you only have two machines available, you can conﬁ gure storage from one 
of the hypervisors.
