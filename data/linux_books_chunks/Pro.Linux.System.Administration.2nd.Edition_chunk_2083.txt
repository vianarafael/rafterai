If you create a partition, the system needs to be able to find the information 
about the partition geometry. It stores this information at the start of the disk (and sometimes has a copy 
stored elsewhere on the disk - more on this shortly).

We have previously described partitioning as slicing up a cake into smaller pieces and that is what we 

can do with the physical disk.
