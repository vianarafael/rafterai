the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under 
the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and oth-
erwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commit-
ment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to 
practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).
