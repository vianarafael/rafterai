However, if you want to manually add a kernel, here is the procedure for modifying 
the grub.conf ﬁ le in Red Hat Enterprise Linux to be able to boot that kernel:

src/kernels/linux-2.6.25-11/arch/i386/boot) to the /boot directory. 
Name the ﬁ le something that reﬂ ects its contents, such as bz-2.6.25-11.
