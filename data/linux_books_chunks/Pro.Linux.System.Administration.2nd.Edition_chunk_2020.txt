tarballs have file extensions that normally indicate how the archive was 
compressed. examples include tar.gz or .tgz for gzip and tar.bz2 or .tbz for bzip2 compression. You can 
see more information about tar on its man page.

The -c flag tells wget to resume a partial download. This means it wonâ€™t restart the download from 
scratch if it was interrupted for some reason.
