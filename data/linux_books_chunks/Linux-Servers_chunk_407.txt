But when someone from the
10.104.42.0/24 network (managed by Keith) asks for the same A record of www.paul.local,
he will get 10.104.33.31 as an answer.

A split-horizon setup can be used to redirect people to local copies of certain services.

In this example we want to decide on specific answers for two networks (Jesse's and Keith's)
and prevent them from using our dns server for recursion, while maintaining the capability
to resolve the internet and our paul.local zone from our own network.

We start by creating three view clauses in named.conf.local.

root@debian7:/etc/bind# cat named.conf.local
view "paul" {
match-clients { 10.104.33.0; localhost; };
include "/etc/bind/named.conf.default-zones";
zone "paul.local" IN {
        type master;
        file "/etc/bind/db.paul.local";
        allow-update { none; };
        };
};      // end view internal

view "jesse" {
match-clients { 10.104.15/24; };
zone "paul.local" IN {
        type master;
        file "/etc/bind/db.paul.local.jesse";
        allow-update { none; };
        };
};      // end view jesse

view "keith" {
match-clients { 10.104.42/24; };
zone "paul.local" IN {
        type master;
        file "/etc/bind/db.paul.local.keith";
        allow-update { none; };
        };
};      // end view keith

Note that we included the default-zones in the internal zone.
