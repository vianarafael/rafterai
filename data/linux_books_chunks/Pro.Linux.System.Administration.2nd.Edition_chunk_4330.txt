It’s a 2,048-bit DH parameter 

file, and we’ve specified the size using the 2048 option. This will be a sufficiently safe key size for several 
years, but you can increase this to 4,096 if you want longer protection from future cracking.

One more thing we will quickly do is create a tls-auth key. This is also used to provide greater security 

to the TLS channel by using a pre-shared key.
