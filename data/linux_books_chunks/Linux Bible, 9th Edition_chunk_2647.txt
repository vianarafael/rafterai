Advantages of using init systems include the ability 
to do the following:

 ■ Identify runlevels—Put together sets of services in what are referred to as runlevels or 

targets

 ■ Establish dependencies—Set service dependencies so, for example, a service that requires 
network interfaces won’t start until all network startup services have started successfully

 ■ Set the default runlevel—Select which runlevel or target starts up when the system boots

 ■ Manage services—Run commands that tell individual services to start, stop, pause, 

restart, or even reload conﬁ guration ﬁ les

Several different init systems are in use with Linux systems today.
