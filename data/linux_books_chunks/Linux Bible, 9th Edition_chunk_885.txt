1 joe root 0 Dec 19 11:23 /home/joe/memo.txt

Notice that the chown command changed the user to joe but left the group as root. To 
change both user and group to joe, you could type the following instead:

4

# chown joe:joe /home/joe/memo.txt
# ls -l /home/joe/memo.txt
-rw-r--r--. 1 joe joe 0 Dec 19 11:23 /home/joe/memo.txt

The chown command can be use recursively as well.
