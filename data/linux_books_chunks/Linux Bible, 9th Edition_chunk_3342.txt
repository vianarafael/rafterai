On the server, the ﬁ le would be owned by the ftp user and ftp group. The 
permissions set on the directory (775) would allow you to see the ﬁ les that were uploaded, 
but not change or overwrite them.

One reason for allowing anonymous FTP, and then enabling it for anonymous uploads, is to 
allow people you don’t know to drop ﬁ les in your uploads folder.
