Consider the 
following Network Manager daemon’s conﬁ guration ﬁ le:

$ cat /etc/init/network-manager.conf
# network-manager - network connection manager
#
# The NetworkManager daemon manages the system's network connections
# automatically switching between the best available.

description     "network connection manager"

start on (local-filesystems and started dbus)
stop on stopping dbus

expect fork
respawn

exec NetworkManager
$

From the example, you can see that there are two events that must take place in order to 
trigger the Upstart init daemon to start the NetworkManager daemon:

 ■ The local-filesystems event—The Upstart init daemon emits this event 
when all the local ﬁ lesystems in the /etc/fstab conﬁ guration ﬁ le have been 
mounted.

 ■ The dbus daemon started event—The Upstart init daemon emits this 

started event when the dbus daemon has reached the start/running state.

Thus, when these two events occur, the Upstart init daemon is informed and starts the 
NetworkManager daemon.

Because the Upstart init daemon can handle these events and tracks the status (state) 
of processes, it is often referred to as a “state machine.” The Upstart init daemon is also 
referred to as an “event engine” because it emits events itself.
