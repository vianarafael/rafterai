We then need to tell Apache which module will provide the basic authentication using 
AuthBasicProvider, which is file. Next, we need to tell Apache which file holds our authentication

To help users determine what theyâ€™re trying to access, we can specify a name for the protected resource 

via the AuthName directive.
