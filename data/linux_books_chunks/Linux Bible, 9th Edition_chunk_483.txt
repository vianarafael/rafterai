You canâ€™t 
do much with Metacity (except get your work done effi ciently). You assign new themes to Metacity and change colors 
and window decorations through the GNOME preferences (described later). Only a few Metacity themes exist, but 
expect the number to grow.

Basic Metacity functions that might interest you are keyboard shortcuts and the workspace switcher.
