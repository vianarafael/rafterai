We pass the bit 
size to openssl via –pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048.

Next we want to generate a CSR. It is this that we would give to the CA for signing. This is generated 
from our private key we just generated. This way we do not have to give anyone our private key in order to get 
our certificate.
