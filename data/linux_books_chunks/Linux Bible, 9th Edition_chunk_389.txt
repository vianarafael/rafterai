Also, although you can 
change ﬁ les, add software, and otherwise conﬁ gure your system, by default, the work you 
do disappears when you reboot, unless you explicitly save that data to your hard drive or 
external storage.

The fact that changes you make to the live environment go away on reboot is very good for 
trying out Linux, but not that great if you want an ongoing desktop or server system.
