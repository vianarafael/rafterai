sadc and sar

The sadc tool writes system utilization data to /var/log/sa/sa??, where ?? is replaced with
the current day of the month. By default, cron runs the sal script every 10 minutes, the sal
script runs sadc for one second. Just before midnight every day, cron runs the sa2 script,
which in turn invokes sar.
