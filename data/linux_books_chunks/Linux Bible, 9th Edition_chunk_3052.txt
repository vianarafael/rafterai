By far, the most popular web server is the Apache (HTTPD) web server, which is sponsored 
by the Apache Software Foundation (http://apache.org). Because Apache is an 

open source project, it is available with every major Linux distribution, including Fedora, RHEL, 
and Ubuntu.

You can conÔ¨Å gure a basic web server to run in Linux in just a few minutes.
