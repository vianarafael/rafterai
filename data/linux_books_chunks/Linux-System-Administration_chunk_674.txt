Runlevel 1 is used for troubleshooting, only
the root user can log on, and only at the console. Runlevel 3 is typical for servers, whereas
runlevel 5 is typical for desktops (graphical logon). Besides runlevels 0, 1 and 6, the use may
vary depending on the distribution. Debian and derived Linux systems have full network
and GUI logon on runlevels 2 to 5.
