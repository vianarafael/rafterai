These, as 

their names imply, describe the back-end data storage.

dn: olcBackend={0}mdb,cn=config
dn: olcDatabase={-1}frontend,cn=config
dn: olcDatabase={0}config,cn=config
dn: olcDatabase={1}mdb,cn=config

To get a full listing, or a backup, of the cn=config DIT, you can issue the following command:

sudo ldapsearch -Q -LLL -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -b cn=config > slapd.ldif

We have used the same command as previously but have removed the dn filter from the end and 
directed the output to the slapd.ldif file.
