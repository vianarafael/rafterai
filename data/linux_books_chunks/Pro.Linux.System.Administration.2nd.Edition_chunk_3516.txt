the source context (scontext) is system_u:system_r:postfix_smtpd_t:s0, and the target 
context (tcontext) is tcontext=unconfined_u:object_r:var_run_t:s0. this means that the process 
with the postfix_smtpd_t type tried to access the socket file with the var_run_t type and couldnâ€™t. 
the solution is to allow the write on the socket file by the postfix smtpd process.
