TLS for mail traffic is the same as when connecting to a web site 
using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) protocol, for example, https://www.gmail.com.

TLS provides two key features for our e-mail communication.

•	

•	

Prevents eavesdropping on our e-mail contents

Encrypts communication between the client and server and hence protects 
authentication

Unfortunately, you should be aware that TLS in e-mail transportation is not really as secure as everyone 

would like.
