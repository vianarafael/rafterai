However, with LVM you can simply expand the logical 
volume and then resize the filesystem on it. If there was no space left in the volume group, you could add a

You need to complete two steps to safely resize the filesystem contained in your logical volume. First, 

you need to resize the logical volume itself, and second, you need to resize the filesystem.
