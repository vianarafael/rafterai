They are 
used sparingly because you generally don’t want one user be able to run applications as another user 
or to have particular elevated privileges (another way to do this is through the su and sudo commands, 
which we’re going to describe further in Chapter 6). as they could also potentially be abused and 
represent a security exposure, they should not be used indiscriminately.
