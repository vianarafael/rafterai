If you were using scp as a backup tool, you would prob-
ably want to keep permissions and time stamps on the ﬁ les if you needed to restore 
the ﬁ les later.

 ■ Symbolic links lost—The batch.1.gz ﬁ le is actually a symbolic link to the 
at.1.gz ﬁ le. Instead of copying the link, scp follows the link and actually 
copies the ﬁ le.
