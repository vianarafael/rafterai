if the line started with a number 5xx, your client and server 
would know this was an error code of some kind. Youâ€™ll see more of these numbers later.

On the next line, we have entered the command EHLO client.example.com. When a client says hello 

and tells the server who it is, it should provide a fully qualified domain name like client.example.com.
