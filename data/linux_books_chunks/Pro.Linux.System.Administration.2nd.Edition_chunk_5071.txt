We need to edit the following file:

$ sudo vi /etc/systemd/journal-upload.conf
[Upload]
URL=https://backup.example.com:19532
ServerKeyFile=/etc/pki/tls/private/gateway.example.com.key
ServerCertificateFile=/etc/pki/tls/certs/gateway.example.com.cert
TrustedCertificateFile=/etc/pki/tls/certs/cacert.pem

This is similar to the remote service file with only one significant difference, as you can no doubt 
see.
