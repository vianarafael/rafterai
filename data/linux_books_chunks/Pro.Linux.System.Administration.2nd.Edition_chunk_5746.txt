Roles are collections of tasks, 
variables, templates, files, and handlers that can be used to configure a particular service, like Nginx (see 
https://galaxy.ansible.com/ for a whole bunch of roles that people have created and shared).

The fact_caching can be stored either in memory on your local host or in different shared service like 

Redis (Redis being an open source key/value store database).
