When in permissive mode,
the file looks like this.

The targeted policy is selected in /etc/selinux/config.

[root@centos65 ~]# cat /etc/selinux/config 
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#       enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#       permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#       disabled - SELinux is fully disabled.
SELINUX=permissive
# SELINUXTYPE= type of policy in use.
