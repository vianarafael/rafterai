You can get Fedora in lots of ways, including these:

 ■ Running Fedora from a live medium—Refer to Appendix A for information on 

downloading and burning Fedora Live image to a DVD or USB drive so you can boot 
it live to use with this chapter.

 ■ Installing Fedora permanently—Install Fedora to your hard disk and boot it from 

there (as described in Chapter 9, “Installing Linux”).

Because the current release of Fedora uses the GNOME 3 interface, most of the procedures 
described here work with other Linux distributions that have GNOME 3 available.
