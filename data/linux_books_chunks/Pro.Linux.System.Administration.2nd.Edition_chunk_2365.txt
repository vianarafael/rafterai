Unlike growing the filesystem, if the volume you are reducing is mounted, 
the following command will umount and remount it.

$ sudo lvreduce --size -2G -r /dev/vg-mail/spool
Do you want to unmount "/tmp/block"? [Y|n] y
fsck from util-linux 2.23.2
/dev/mapper/vg--mail-spool: 11/262144 files (0.0% non-contiguous), 53326/1048576 blocks
resize2fs 1.42.9 (28-Dec-2013)
Resizing the filesystem on /dev/mapper/vg--mail-spool to 524288 (4k) blocks.
The filesystem on /dev/mapper/vg--mail-spool is now 524288 blocks long.

   Size of logical volume vg-mail/spool changed from 4.00 GiB (1024 extents) to 2.00 GiB  

(512 extents).

  Logical volume spool successfully resized.

And now our filesystem has been reduced.

$ df -h /tmp/block
Filesystem                  Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/vg--mail-spool  1.9G   12M  1.8G   1% /var/spool

LVM Commands
Although itâ€™s a little bit more work to set up than simple partitions, LVM allows you to use your storage space 
in a far more flexible manner.
