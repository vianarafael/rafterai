The major difference between the 
versions is the number of CPUs (central processing units) supported, with RHEL supporting up to two CPUs 
and RHELAP supporting an unlimited number.

Red Hat platforms are commonly used by corporate organizations as server platforms due to the 
dedicated support and service levels available from the vendor.
