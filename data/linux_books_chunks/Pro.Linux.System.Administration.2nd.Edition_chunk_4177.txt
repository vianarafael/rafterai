Recycle Oldest Volume = Yes means the oldest volume will be used before any other volume when 
more than one volume is available. This has the obvious advantage of destroying any existing data on those 
volumes at the latest possible time, so you will still be able to restore from those volumes up until that time.
Last in our Pool resource is the Label definition.
