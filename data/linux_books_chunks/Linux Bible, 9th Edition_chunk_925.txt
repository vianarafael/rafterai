For example, to open a ﬁ le called 
/tmp/test, type the following command:

$ vi /tmp/test

If this is a new ﬁ le, you should see something similar to the following:

"/tmp/test" [New File]

A blinking box at the top represents where your cursor is. The bottom line keeps you 
informed about what is going on with your editing (here, you just opened a new ﬁ le).
