The features that make up 
Linux and similar computer operating systems include the following:

 ■ Detecting and preparing hardware—When the Linux system boots up (when you 
turn on your computer), it looks at the components on your computer (CPU, hard 
drive, network cards, and so on) and loads the software (drivers and modules) 
needed to access those particular hardware devices.

 ■ Managing processes—The operating system must keep track of multiple processes 
running at the same time and decide which have access to the CPU and when.
