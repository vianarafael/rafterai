As you look at the long listing, notice that the ﬁ rst character of each line shows the 
type of ﬁ le. A hyphen (-) indicates a regular ﬁ le, d indicates a directory, and l ( lowercase 
L) indicates a symbolic link. An executable ﬁ le (a script or binary ﬁ le that runs as a 
command) has execute bits turned on (x).
