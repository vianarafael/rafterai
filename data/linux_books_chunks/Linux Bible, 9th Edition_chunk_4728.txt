Also, there are 
 additional nmap scans that may be beneﬁ cial to your organization. Look at the nmap

If you have been following along and lowered your server’s fi rewall to conduct these nmap scans, be sure to raise it 
again: systemctl start firewalld.service.

You still need to implement controls for those services your Linux server should offer.
