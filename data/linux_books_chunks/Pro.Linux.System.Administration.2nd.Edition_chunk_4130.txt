that backup itself can be copied off to longer-term storage at particular points or via a virtual 
full job that can take all backups into a new long-term backup.

the backup starts with a full backup, of course, but then subsequent incremental backups are 
performed, possibly nightly, and then consolidation jobs are run on the backup server daily or when 
appropriate.
