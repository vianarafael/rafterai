The differential backup will do a very 
similar job as the incremental, but it will back up all files changed since the last full save. Letâ€™s discuss that

Whenever a differential or incremental backup is performed, the Bareos File daemon clients will check 
the file list for modified file timestamps and changed file timestamps and compare them to the previous full 
backup.
