what if you need to install dozens or hundreds of Linux systems? What if you want 
to install those systems in particular ways that need to be repeated over multiple 
installations? The last section of this chapter describes efﬁ cient ways of installing 
multiple Linux systems, using network installation features and kickstart ﬁ les.

A fourth method of installation not covered in this chapter is to install Linux as a virtual 
machine on a virtualization host, such as Virtual Box or VMware system.
