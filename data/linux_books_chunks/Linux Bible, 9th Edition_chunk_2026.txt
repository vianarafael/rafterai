Using ACLs, assign default 
permissions to that directory so the adm user has read/write/execute permission 
to that directory and any ﬁ les or directories created in it. Create the /tmp/mydir/
testing/ directory and /tmp/mydir/newfile.txt ﬁ le, and make sure the 
adm user was also assigned full read/write/execute permissions.
