I connected a hard drive from an old Microsoft Windows system, and I had it mounted on 
the /win directory. I added the ro option so it would mount read-only.

The next two entries represent remote Ô¨Å lesystems. On the /remote directory, the 
/nfsstuff directory is mounted read/write (rw) from the host at address 192.168.0.27 as 
an NFS share.
