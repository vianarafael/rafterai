Remember, we spoke about Apparmor in Chapter 12; it is 
a security module that describes security access for system resources (such as ports and files).

We will add the following to our /etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.sbin.named file, remembering that we 

add localhost changes into the /etc/apparmor.d/local directory:

# Samba4 DLZ and Active Directory Zones
/var/lib/samba/lib/** rm,
/var/lib/samba/private/dns.keytab r,
/var/lib/samba/private/named.conf r,
/var/lib/samba/private/dns/** rwk,

After saving this file, we then need to load this into Apparmor with the following:

$ sudo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.named

To configure our bind9 service in preparation for our Samba configuration, we are going to add the 

following to the bottom of our /etc/bind/named.conf.options file:

include "/var/lib/samba/private/named.conf";

We will need to reload our bind9 configuration with the following:

$ sudo rndc reload

Now itâ€™s time to configure Samba.
