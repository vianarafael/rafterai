To copy some ﬁ les to the /var/mystuff directory, type the following on the NFS 

server:

# cp /etc/hosts /etc/services /var/mystuff

From the NFS client, to make sure you can see the ﬁ les just added to that directory 
and to make sure you can’t write ﬁ les to that directory from the client, type the 
following:

# ls /var/remote
hosts    services
# touch /var/remote/file1
touch: cannot touch '/var/remote/file1': Read-only file system
