     }
     File = "/etc"
     File = "/var/lib" File = "/data" File = "/home"
     Plugin = "python:module_path=/usr/lib64/bareos/plugins:module_name=bareos-fd-mysql"
     }
  Exclude {
    File = "/proc"
    File = "/sys"
    File = "/dev"
    File = "/run"
    File = "/tmp"
    File = "/data/backups"
  }
}

We are going to create a new JobDefs for headoffice.example.com also.

JobDefs {
  Name = "DBLinux"
  Type = Backup
  Level = Incremental
  Client = headoffice-fd
  FileSet = "DBLinux"
  Schedule = "WeeklyCycle"
  Storage = Gluster
  Messages = Standard
  Pool = Incremental
  Priority = 10
  Write Bootstrap = "/var/lib/bareos/%c.bsr"
  Full Backup Pool = Full
  Incremental Backup Pool = Incremental
}

We have created a new JobDefs and added the DBLinux FileSet for the database server.
