So the delay below is three seconds, not thirty!

boot = /dev/hda
delay = 30

image = /boot/vmlinuz
  root = /dev/hda1
  label = Red Hat 5.2

image = /boot/vmlinuz
  root = /dev/hda2
  label = S.U.S.E. 8.0

other = /dev/hda4
  table = /dev/hda
  label = MS-DOS 6.22

The configration file shows three example stanzas. The first one boots Red Hat from the first
partition on the first disk (hda1).
