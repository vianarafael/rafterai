The libvirt-daemon-conÔ¨Å g-network package creates the default network interface that 
lets the virtual machines access external networks (through the host) using Network 
Address Translation (NAT). The default address range assigned to the virtual machines is 
192.168.122.2 through 192.168.122.254.

Other packages you need should already be included with the Fedora Workstation install.
