DnsseC provides a way that they root 
zone validates records from the tLDs that can then validate the records other domains under them.

It does this by signing resource record sets, rrsets (a rrset for example, is all the MX resource records 
in a zone file, or all the ns resource records, or all the aaaa resource records). these rrsets are signed 
by a zone signing private key.
