For example, we have SSH 

traffic coming in on enp0s8 and leaving on enp0s9, we would write the ufw routing rule like this:

$ sudo ufw route allow in on enp0s8 out on enp0s9 to any port 22 proto tcp

Here we are saying allow SSH traffic (22) coming in on enp0s8 and out on enp0s9 to any destination IP 

address.
