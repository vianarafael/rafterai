That should be accompanied with a slowdown of system performance.

 ■ As the top screen redraws every few seconds, if there is a process with a memory 
leak (continuously asking for and using more memory, but not giving any memory 
back), the amount of VIRT memory grows, but more important, the RES memory 
continues to grow for that process.

 ■ If the Swap space actually runs out, the kernel starts to kill off processes to deal 

with this out-of-memory condition.

Dealing with memory problems
In the short term, you can do several things to deal with this out-of-memory condition:

 ■ Kill a process.
