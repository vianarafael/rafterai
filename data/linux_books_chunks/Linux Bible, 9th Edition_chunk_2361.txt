System logging is one of the basic services conﬁ gured for Linux to keep track of what is 
happening on the system.

The rsyslog service (rsyslogd daemon) provides the features to gather log messages 
from software running on the Linux system and direct those messages to local log ﬁ les, 
devices, or remote logging hosts.
