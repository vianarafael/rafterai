Other types of services also available include local Unix sockets 
and named pipes. Unix domain sockets and named pipes are used to send messages between services; see 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe.
Next, we have a series of settings for each service. Each setting is specified on the line in sequence and 

separated with spaces.
