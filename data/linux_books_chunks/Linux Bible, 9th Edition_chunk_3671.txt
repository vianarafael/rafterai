Instead of typing the local mount point (/oak/apps), 
you could have typed the remote ﬁ lesystem name (oak:/apps) and had other information 
ﬁ lled in.

When naming mount points, including the name of the remote NFS server in that name can help you remember where 
the fi les are actually being stored.
