Removing
a Logical Volume requires the name of the Volume Group.

[root@RHEL5 ~]# lvremove vg42/MyLV
Do you really want to remove active logical volume "MyLV"? [y/n]: y
  Logical volume "MyLV" successfully removed
[root@RHEL5 ~]#

Removing multiple Logical Volumes will request confirmation for each individual volume.

[root@RHEL5 ~]# lvremove vg42/MyLV vg42/MyLV2 vg42/MyLV3
Do you really want to remove active logical volume "MyLV"? [y/n]: y
  Logical volume "MyLV" successfully removed
Do you really want to remove active logical volume "MyLV2"? [y/n]: y
  Logical volume "MyLV2" successfully removed
Do you really want to remove active logical volume "MyLV3"? [y/n]: y
  Logical volume "MyLV3" successfully removed
[root@RHEL5 ~]#
