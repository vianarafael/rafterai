Bareos gives a name or label to volumes based on this 

format. Tapes from autoloaders with barcode labels are not automatically read into Bareos and need to be 
manually labeled when you add a new tape. In the case of tape media, a small section of data is written to 
the start of the tape, giving it the label name for that volume.
