Prepend the remote host's IP with a @ sign.

Sending logs to a remote server

A seen above the local syslogd can send logs to a remote host (say 192.168.10.33) running 
a syslogd. Assume we want to send all logs to this remote host, this would be the syntax:

*.* @192.168.10.33

Configuring syslogd to accept remote logs

In this case we want remote systems to send their logs to our server.
