We will use case to test and limit the commands
# we are running.

In Listing 14-1, we are using the Bash scripting language to test the commands that are being presented 

by the ssh user.

The case statement tests the variable $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND to make sure it contains only the 
command rsync --server.
