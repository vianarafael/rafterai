With the implementation of a simple Bash 
script, you can automate your backups by connecting to the remote host and copying the files back to 
your backup host.

In this section, we are going to do the following:

•	 Create a user to manage our backups

•	 Create our passphrase-less SSH keys

•	 Copy our keys to our remote hosts

•	 Create a script that allows only certain commands via SSH

•	 Create a script that uses rsync to sync files from remote hosts

•	

Add that script to cron

We introduced you to SSH communications in Chapters 4 and 10.
