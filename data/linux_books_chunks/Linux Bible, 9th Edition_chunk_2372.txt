Modules that are currently 
disabled are preceded by a pound sign (#). The imjournal module lets rlogind access 
the systemd journal. The imuxsock module is needed to accept messages from the local 
system (it should not be commented out—preceded by a pound sign—unless you have a 
speciﬁ c reason to do so).
