Finally, try to ping a system 
 somewhere on the Internet:

Kernel IP routing table

192.168.0.0  *            255.255.255.0  U     2       0     0 eth0
default      192.168.0.1  0.0.0.0        UG    0             0 eth0

The default line shows that the default gateway (UG) is at address 192.168.0.1 and that the 
address can be reached over the eth0 card.
