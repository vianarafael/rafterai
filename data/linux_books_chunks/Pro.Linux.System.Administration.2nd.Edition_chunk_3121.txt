A reverse proxy is used when sites serve large amounts 
of content that doesnâ€™t change very often. By allowing the data that does not change to be cached by the 
reverse proxy, the load on the underlying web servers can be reduced. This kind of proxy is also known as a 
web accelerator.

Configuration
