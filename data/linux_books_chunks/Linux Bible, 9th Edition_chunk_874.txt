Using letters, for 
each ﬁ le you can change permission for the user (u), group (g), other (o), and all users (a). 
What you would change includes the read (r), write (w), and execute (x) bits. For example, 
start with a ﬁ le that has all permissions open (rwxrwxrwx). Run the following chmod 
commands using minus sign options.
