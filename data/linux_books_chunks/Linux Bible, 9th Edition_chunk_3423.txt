To start the nmb service 
(nmbd daemon) in Fedora or RHEL 7, type the following:

# systemctl enable nmb.service
# systemctl start nmb.service
# systemctl status nmb.service

In RHEL 6 and earlier, you would type the following to start the nmb service:

# service nmb start
# service nmb status
# chkconfig nmb on
# chkconfig --list nmb

Regardless of how the NetBIOS service was started, the nmbd daemon should now be 
 running and ready to serve NetBIOS name-to-address mapping.
