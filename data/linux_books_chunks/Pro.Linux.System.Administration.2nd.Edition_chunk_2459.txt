It is a common practice to set your local network hosts to two or three local ntp servers, which then 
synchronize with servers from the ntp pool.

If you choose to change these settings, your ntp.conf can restart the NTP server with sudo service ntp 

restart on Ubuntu or sudo systemctl restart ntpd on CentOS.
