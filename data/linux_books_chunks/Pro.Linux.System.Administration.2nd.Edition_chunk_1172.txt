In the line above we are making use of the special variable $? in our bash shell which 
holds the exit code of the last command run.

Now that we know how to see the status of our service and we can see that is it already running, let’s 

stop the service.

$ sudo systemctl stop postfix.service

There is no noticeable output from that command so if we query the status, we can see that it is 

stopped.

Clearly we can see that the service is “inactive” and that the Main PID was killed with a TERM signal.

 processes can accept “signals” from the kill command.
