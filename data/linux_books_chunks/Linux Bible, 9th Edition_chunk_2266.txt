Instead, their services are registered with the xinetd daemon. When 
requests come to the xinetd daemon for a service, at that time, the xinetd launches the 
requested service and hands the request off to that service.

The advantage of the xinetd daemon is that you can have fewer daemon processes 
 running and consuming memory and process slots.
