This will in turn run through the old /etc/rcN.d directory and start and stop services 
for that particular runlevel.

You manage Upstart with the initclt command and that allows you to start, stop services.

$ sudo initctl start rsyslog
$ sudo initctl stop rsyslog

Upstart doesnâ€™t have a tool to enable or disable services, but you can use pre-start script section to 
source in a file that contains an ENABLED variable set.
