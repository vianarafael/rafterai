You may, in fact, have 
multiple NICs with multiple interfaces to different networks. You may also have multiple 
routers on your local network that provide routes to particular private networks.

For example, suppose you have a router (or other system acting as a router) on your 
local network; you can add a custom route to that router via NetworkManager.
