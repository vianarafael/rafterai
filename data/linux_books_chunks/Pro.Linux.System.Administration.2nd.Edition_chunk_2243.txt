Options for each supported filesystem can be found in the mount manual page.

The dump field contains a digit (0 or 1), which tells the system whether or not to dump some filesystem 

meta-information when a filesystem check is to be performed. This dump information can be used by the 
filesystem repair tools. A 0 means that the filesystem does not need to be dumped.
