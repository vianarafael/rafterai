To recursively copy all the ﬁ les from the /usr/share/selinux directory on a 
remote system to the /tmp directory on your local system in such a way that all 
the modiﬁ cation times on the ﬁ les are updated to the time on the local system 
when they are copied, do the following:

$ scp -r joe@localhost:/usr/share/selinux /tmp
joe@localhost's password: ********
irc.pp.bz2                          100% 9673     9.5KB/s   00:00
dcc.pp.bz2                          100%   15KB  15.2KB/s   00:01
$ ls -l /tmp/selinux | head
