We have used String and Numeric, but the others, like Boolean, Array, and 
Hash are described here: https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/4.8/lang_data_type.html.

In Listing 9-11 we have included the apache module. This is a module we are now going to install 
using the Puppet module command like we described earlier, and it will be the puppetlab/apache module.
