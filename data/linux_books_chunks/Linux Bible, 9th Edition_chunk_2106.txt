Here’s how to do 
that for the partitions just created:

 ■ sdc1—To make this into a regular Linux ext4 ﬁ lesystem, type the following:

# mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdc1

 ■ sdc2—To format this as a swap area, type the following:

# mkswap /dev/sdc2

 ■ sdc3—To make this into an ext2 ﬁ lesystem (the default) type the following:

# mkfs /dev/sdc3

 ■ sdc5—To make this into a VFAT ﬁ lesystem (the default) type the following:

# mkfs -t vfat /dev/sdc5

12

 ■ sdc6—To make this into a LVM physical volume type the following:

# pvcreate /dev/sdc6

These partitions are now ready to be mounted, used as a swap area, or added to an LVM 
 volume group.
