The characters and words you 
can type after a command are called options and arguments.

Understanding command syntax
Most commands have one or more options you can add to change the commandâ€™s behavior. 
Options typically consist of a single letter, preceded by a hyphen. However, you can group 
single-letter options together or precede each with a hyphen, to use more than one option 
at a time.
