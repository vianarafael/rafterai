The two 
recursive (-r) copies copy the bash-completion directory, and all ﬁ les it contains, ﬁ rst to 
new /tmp/a/ and /tmp/b/ directories. If you run ls -l on those two directories, you 
see that for the cp command run with the archive (-a) option, the date/time stamps and 
 permissions are maintained by the copy.
