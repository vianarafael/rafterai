The 
 smallest unit of storage that can be used from this physical volume is 4.0MiB, which is 
referred to as a Physical Extent (PE).

Notice that LVM tools show disk space in MiB and GiB. One MB is 1,000,000 bytes (10∧6), while a MiB is 1,048,576 
bytes (2∧20). A MiB is a more accurate way to refl ect how data are stored on a computer.
