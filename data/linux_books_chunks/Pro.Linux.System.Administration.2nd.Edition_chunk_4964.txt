The WantedBy will mean that this will be started when the socket.target is activated.

Looking now at the service file, /etc/systemd/system/graphite-api.service, we can see the 

following details:

[Unit]
Description=Graphite-API service
Requires=graphite-api.socket

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/gunicorn -b 127.0.0.1:8881 -w2 graphite_api.app:app
Restart=on-failure
ExecReload=/bin/kill -s HUP $MAINPID
ExecStop=/bin/kill -s TERM $MAINPID
PrivateTmp=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Here you can see that we call the gunicorn command to start graphite_api.app.
