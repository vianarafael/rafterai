On CentOS, you specify a section starting 
with %packages and then the list of package groups or packages you want to install.

%packages
@ Administration Tools
@ Server Configuration Tools
@ System Tools
@ Text-based Internet
dhcp

We specify an at symbol (@), a space, and then the name of the package group we want to install, for 
example, Administration Tools.
