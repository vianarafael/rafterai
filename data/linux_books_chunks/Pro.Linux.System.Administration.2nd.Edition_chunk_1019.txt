You can also 
edit the GRUB menu and change parameters, commands, and arguments before proceeding to boot into 
your chosen kernel.

For example, we could choose to boot into what is called single-user mode, or maintenance mode. This 

special mode, used when something is broken on your host, restricts access to the host to the root user: 
usually at the system console.
