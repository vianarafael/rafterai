If you are upgrading Fedora from one version to 

another (for example, Fedora 20 to Fedora 21), you can use the preupgrade tool 
instead of just typing yum upgrade. The advantage of running preupgrade ﬁ rst 
is that it checks dependencies and downloads all needed packages before commit-
ting your system to the upgrade so you don’t end up with a half upgraded system.
