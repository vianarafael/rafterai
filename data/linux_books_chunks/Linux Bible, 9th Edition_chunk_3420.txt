The WantedBy line indicates that smb.service should 
start when the system boots up into multi-user mode (multi-user.target), which it 
does by default.

Part IV: Becoming a Linux Server Administrator

In RHEL 6 and earlier, you can start the Samba service as follows:

# service smb start
Starting SMB services:        [  OK  ]
# chkconfig smb on
# service smb status
smbd (pid  28056) is running...
# chkconfig --list smb
smb              0:off  1:off  2:on  3:on  4:on  5:on  6:off

Whether you are running your Samba server on RHEL, Fedora, or another Linux system, 
you can check access to the Samba server using the smbclient command (from the 
samba-client package).
