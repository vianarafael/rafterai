At this stage the entire system is available and the bootloader can be fixed

When a bootloader is misconfigured one can use an alternative bootloader (on a floppy or 
a CD). This bootloader will  load a kernel which is instructed to use the root device on the 
hard drive.

This method is called a boot disk and is used to recover a specific system.
