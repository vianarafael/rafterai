Here the 
user ataylor is a member of a unique UPG scheme primary group called ataylor, and we’re trying to add 
her to the additional supplemental groups printing and finance.

If we execute that command now, however, it will fail because each of these groups needs to exist before 

we can add a user to them, otherwise we’ll get an error message and the user will fail to be created.
