Let’s do 
that now by first changing into the /etc/pki/tls directory and executing the following:

$ openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout private/gateway.example.com.key 
-out gateway.example.com.req

We’ve generated a 4,096-bit RSA key in the /etc/pki/tls/private directory and created a CSR. You 

will be prompted to populate the required fields (State, City, etc.).
