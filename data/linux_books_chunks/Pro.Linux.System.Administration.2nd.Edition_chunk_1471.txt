The first numbers of each 
line, for example, 19:26:35.250934, are timestamps.

ARP, Request who-has 192.168.0.1 tell 192.168.0.254

The first field (taking away the timestamp) is the protocol in the TCP/IP model. This is an ARP request, 

and ARP operates at the layer 2 (or data link layer) of the TCP/IP protocol stack. ARP is used to match up 
MAC addresses to IP addresses.
