This works only if you don’t have any unsaved changes.

 ■ :q!—Quits the current ﬁ le and doesn’t save the changes you just made to the ﬁ le.

If you’ve really trashed the fi le by mistake, the :q! command is the best way to exit and abandon your changes. The 
fi le reverts to the most recently changed version. So, if you just saved with :w, you are stuck with the changes up 
to that point.
