Make dpkg list the package contents and pipe the output to grep to limit the output 
to files and directories that contain the string bin, for example: dpkg -L <package name> | grep bin.

Performing a File Search
For files that are already present on the host, you can determine the package they belong to by using dpkg:

$ dpkg -S /usr/sbin/userdel

This command tells you what package provides the userdel command.

Installing Packages
All Ubuntu package files are made up of three parts: the package name, the package version, and the 
target architecture.
