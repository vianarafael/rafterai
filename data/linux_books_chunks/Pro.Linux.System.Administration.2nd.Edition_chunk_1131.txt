For a long time Linux systems were initialized by a program called SystemV 
Init, SysV Init, SysV, or just init. Init has since been replaced by another program called Systemd in most 
major distributions, including CentOS and Ubuntu. However, both of these distributions still support 
SysVInit startup scripts.
