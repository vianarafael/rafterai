We can write prestart scripts that run prior to executing the main 
script section.

While Upstart is different from SysV and has no natural concept of runlevels, it has been made 

backward compatible with SysV Init scripts. These help emulate the old-style SysV scripts by executing the /
etc/init.d/rc script.
