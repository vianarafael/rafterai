If we look at the rule files in the /etc/ufw/ directory we can see the instructions that ufw uses 
to create the Netfilter rulesets.

Let’s now show some of the basic commands.
You enable or disable ufw like so:

$ sudo ufw enable|disable

To get an output of current firewall status:

$ sudo ufw status numbered
Status: active

   To             Action     From
   --             ------       ----
[ 1] 22/tcp        ALLOW IN  Anywhere
[ 2] 22/tcp (v6)     ALLOW IN  Anywhere (v6)

This is saying we are going to allow traffic coming in (ALLOW IN), that originates from any network 

(Anywhere), and, that is destined for port TCP 22 (on both IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces).

You can add another rule like the following to allow http traffic to any local interface:

CHAPter 7 ■ NetworkiNg AND FirewAllS

$ sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
Rule added
Rule added (v6)
$ sudo ufw status numbered
...
[ 3] 80             ALLOW IN  Anywhere
[ 4] 80 (v6)         ALLOW IN  Anywhere (v6)
...

In the above you can see that we have added access to port 80 from anywhere on all IPv4 and IPv6 

interfaces.
