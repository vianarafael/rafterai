Like in the OUTPUT chain, 
these packets are routed by the Netfilter program and passed on to other tables (mangle, nat) before they 
leave on the wire.

If the packets are destined for the firewall host itself, they will be passed to the INPUT chain and if they 

are accepted by any rule sets in that chain will be passed to the application (via the security table).
