Location tags are 
 processed last and override the settings in Directory and Files blocks.

Match versions of these tags—DirectoryMatch, FilesMatch, and LocationMatch—
have the same function but can contain regular expressions in the resource speciﬁ cation. 
FilesMatch and LocationMatch blocks are processed at the same time as Files and 
Location, respectively.
