Many of the extensions help you add back in features from GNOME 2, including these:

 ■ Applications Menu—Adds an Applications menu to the top panel, just as it was in 

GNOME 2.

 ■ Places Status Indicator—Adds a systems status menu, similar to the Places menu 

in GNOME 2, to let you quickly navigate to useful folders on your system.

 ■ Window list—Adds a list of active windows to the top panel, similar to the Window 

list that appeared on the bottom panel in GNOME 2.

To install an extension, simply select the ON button next to the name.
