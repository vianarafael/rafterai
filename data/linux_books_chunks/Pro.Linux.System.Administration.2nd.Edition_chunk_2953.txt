We are going to concentrate on 
basic tunings for the XtraDB engine in MariaDB.

To show the current settings of the MariaDB, you can issue the following command from the  

command line:

MariaDB [(none)]> show variables;

This command produces a long list of all the variables currently stored in MariaDB. To see individual 

settings, we can use the SQL shown in FigureÂ 11-4.
