If the host is not part of a domain, it can still share resources, but it will have to maintain its own 
authentication and access lists.

Setting the workgroup here does not make our host a PDC, just part of a workgroup. We have set this to 

our domain name, EXAMPLE.

workgroup = SAMBA

Next you need to configure NetBIOS.
