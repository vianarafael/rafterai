Here is an example:

network-interfaces: |
  iface eth0 inet static
  address 192.168.100.50
  network 192.168.100.0
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  broadcast 192.168.1.255
  gateway 192.168.100.1
bootcmd:
  - ifdown eth0
  - ifup eth0

The network-interfaces values shown here identify the eth0 interface within the 
cloud instance as containing static addresses (in other words, not from DHCP).
