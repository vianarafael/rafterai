ipv4 mapped ipv6 address

Some applications use ipv4 addresses embedded in an ipv6 address. (Yes there will be an
era of migration with both ipv4 and ipv6 in use.) The ipv6 address then looks like this:

::ffff:192.168.1.42/96

Indeed a mix of decimal and hexadecimal characters...

21.5. link local addresses

ipv6 addresses starting with fe8.
