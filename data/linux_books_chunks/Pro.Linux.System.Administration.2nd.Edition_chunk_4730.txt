It is a few releases old, and if you 
are looking for a more recent version, you can get the .deb packages from the web siteâ€™s download page 
(https://www.ldap-account-manager.org/lamcms/releases) or from the Debian repository.
For LAM, you will need a version of PHP installed on your host higher or equal to 5.2.4.
To install it, you issue the following:

$ sudo aptitude install php-mcrypt php-zip ldap-account-manager apache2

At the time of writing, the version provided in the Ubuntu repository (5.2-1ubuntu1) does not support 

the default PHP (7.x) installed with Xenial.
