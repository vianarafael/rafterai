MaC, on the other hand, mandates the permissions for resources in 
the kernel, and the permissions can be changed only by loading access policies into the kernel from 
user space.

Selinux was developed by the US National Security agency (NSa) and works by tagging each object 
on the system and then using the Selinux security module to validate access to the resources.
