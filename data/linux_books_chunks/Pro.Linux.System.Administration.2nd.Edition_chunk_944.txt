You can specify the user you want the command to be started as by placing the 
username in parentheses in front of the command, as follows:

ataylor au-mel-centos-1=(mysql) /usr/bin/mysqld,(named) /usr/sbin/named

As you can imagine, lists of authorized commands, users, and hosts can become quite long. The sudo 
command also comes with the option of defining aliases.
