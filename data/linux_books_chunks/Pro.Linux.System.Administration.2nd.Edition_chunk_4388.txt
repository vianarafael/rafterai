On Ubuntu, weâ€™ve specified the standard shadow password PAM authentication file, 
passwd, as the authentication mechanism to use. On CentOS, we could specify the system-auth default PAM 
authentication file.

For other forms of authentication, you specify here an appropriate PAM authentication file for that 
mechanism.
