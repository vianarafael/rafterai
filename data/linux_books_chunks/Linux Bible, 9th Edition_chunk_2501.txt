All other packets go to the default route via the address 192.168.0.1. 
As for the ﬂ ags shown in the output, a U says the route is up, a G identiﬁ es the interface as a 
gateway, and an H says the target is a host (as is the case with the VPN connection).

So far, I have shown you the routes to leave the local system.
