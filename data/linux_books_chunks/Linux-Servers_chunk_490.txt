If
you do not succeed in pinging between the two networks (on different subnets), then use a
sniffer like wireshark or tcpdump to discover the problem.

Did you forget to add a default gateway to the LAN machines ? Use route add default
gw 'ip-address'.

root@left~# route add default gw 192.168.60.1

root@right~# route add default gw 192.168.70.1

You should be able to ping when packet forwarding is enabled (and both default gateways
are  properly  configured).
