The Storage daemon controls access to the backup media, tape drives, and autoloaders. It can be configured 
to even write to GlusterFS, and we will demonstrate this shortly.

The File daemon sits on the target host waiting for connections from the Bareos Director daemon. 
When it receives the instructions to start a backup, the target host gets a list of the files it is to back up.
