If you try to change to a directory to which you 
don’t have suitable permissions, you will get an error message:

$ cd /root
-bash: cd: /root: Permission denied

 ■ Note 

 We will talk about permissions in the section “permissions,” later in this chapter.

So now you know how to move around in your directory tree.
