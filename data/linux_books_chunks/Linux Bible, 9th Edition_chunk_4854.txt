GlusterFS (www
.gluster.org) is a scale-out Ô¨Å lesystem that is often used in cloud environments.

For the simple mini-cloud example in this chapter, I use NFS to provide shared storage 
between the hypervisors.

Cloud authentication
To be able to limit how much cloud resources a user can consume, and possibly track and 
change for that use, you need authentication mechanisms.
