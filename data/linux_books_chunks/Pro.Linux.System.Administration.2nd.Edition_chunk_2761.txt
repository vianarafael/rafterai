This feature takes advantage of the client/server modes of the X 
Window System by forwarding any connection attempts to an X server on the remote host through your SSH 
connection to the X server on your local host.

To force all users to use key-based authentication, you can add PasswordAuthentication no in the 

server configuration file.
