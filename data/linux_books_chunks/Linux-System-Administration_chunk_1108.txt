copy the public key to the other computer

To copy the public key from Alice's server tot Bob's laptop, Alice decides to use scp.

[alice@RHEL5 .ssh]$ scp id_rsa.pub bob@192.168.48.92:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
bob@192.168.48.92's password: 
id_rsa.pub                                    100%  393     0.4KB/s   00:00

Be careful when copying a second key! Do not overwrite the first key, instead append the
key to the same ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file!

cat id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Alice could also have used ssh-copy-id like in this example.

ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_rsa.pub bob@192.168.48.92
