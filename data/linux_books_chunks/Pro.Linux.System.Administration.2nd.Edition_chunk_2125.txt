GIGABYTES

When a hard-disk manufacturer advertises its product, it wants the available storage space to seem 
as large as possible, so it calculates each gigabyte as 1,000 megabytes, which in turn is 1,000,000 
kilobytes, which is 1,000,000,000 bytes.

however, because all calculations on computers are done via binary arithmetic, the actual multiplication 
value is 1,024 (gibi means 230).
