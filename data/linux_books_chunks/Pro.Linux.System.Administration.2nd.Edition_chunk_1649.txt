To do that we issue the following:

iptables –t filter –I IPV4-INCOMING 1 –p tcp –-dport 22 –j ACCEPT

When you look at the third line now in the IPV4-INCOMING chain, you can see that our rule has been 

inserted and has the target of ACCEPT.

num target   prot opt source   destination
1  ACCEPT   tcp -- anywhere  anywhere   tcp   dpt:ssh
2  ACCEPT   all -- anywhere  anywhere   ctstate INVALID
3  ACCEPT   all -- anywhere  anywhere   ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED
4  DROP    all -- anywhere  anywhere
5  ACCEPT   tcp -- anywhere  anywhere   tcp dpt:ssh

We will remove rule number 5 like we removed our previous rule with the –D IPV4-INCOMING 5 switch.
