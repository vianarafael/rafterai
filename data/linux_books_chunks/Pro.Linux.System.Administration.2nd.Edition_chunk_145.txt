The drop-down allows us to select 
the different options for our network interface. DHCP we have already discussed, Link-Local Only is only 
useful for communicating to hosts in the local segment (not normally used) as is Shared to other computers. 
Selecting these two options for your network interface will mean you will not be assigned an IP address that 
can route through to the Internet.
