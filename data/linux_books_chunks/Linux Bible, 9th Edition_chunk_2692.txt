Each one 
 contains scripts to start and stop services for its particular runlevel.

# ls -d /etc/rc.d/rc?.d
/etc/rc.d/rc0.d  /etc/rc.d/rc2.d  /etc/rc.d/rc4.d  /etc/rc.d/rc6.d
/etc/rc.d/rc1.d  /etc/rc.d/rc3.d  /etc/rc.d/rc5.d

Actually, the Ô¨Å les in the /etc/rc.d/rc#.d directories are not scripts, but instead 
 symbolic links to scripts in the /etc/rc.d/init.d directory.
