This protocol is mainly used by networked Microsoft Windows computers.

Connecting to a Samba server (or to a Microsoft computer) is also done with the mount
command.

This example shows how to connect to the 10.0.0.42 server, to a share named data2.

[root@centos65 ~]# mount -t cifs -o user=paul //10.0.0.42/data2 /home/data2
Password: 
[root@centos65 ~]# mount | grep cifs
//10.0.0.42/data2 on /home/data2 type cifs (rw)

The above requires yum install cifs-client.
