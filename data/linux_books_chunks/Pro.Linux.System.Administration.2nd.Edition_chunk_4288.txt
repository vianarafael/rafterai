The openvpn package on both Ubuntu and CentOS will install 
appropriate Systemd service scripts.

However, with OpenVPN, the way we start and stop the services is slightly different. Taking a look 
at CentOS, for example, we need to pass the name of the OpenVPN configuration we want to start. The 
systemctl command can take arguments.
