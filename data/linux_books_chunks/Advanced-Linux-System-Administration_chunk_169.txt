When the map file /etc/auto.master is changed it is necessary to restart autofs. For 
example if mount points have been deleted, then the associated automount daemon is 
terminated. Likewise,  new daemons are started for newly defined mount points.

Multiple filesystems can be mounted on a single mount point.
