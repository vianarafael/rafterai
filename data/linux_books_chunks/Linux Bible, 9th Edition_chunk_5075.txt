The wizard takes you through the selection of different instance types (gen-
eral purpose or optimized) and lets you conﬁ gure instance details, add storage, tag the 
instance, and conﬁ gure security.

After the virtual machine is conﬁ gured, you can work with the virtual machine directly 
from a console window or log in over the network using ssh and public/private keypairs.
