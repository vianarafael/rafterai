Mail servers can be configured to encrypt the sending and receiving of e-mail via STARTTLS. 
Because mail servers are not required to use STARTTLS, many will downgrade to clear text, or they can be 
vulnerable to malicious downgrade attacks. So while we recommend using a secure transport like TLS, it 
is not a guaranteed protection against eavesdropping.
