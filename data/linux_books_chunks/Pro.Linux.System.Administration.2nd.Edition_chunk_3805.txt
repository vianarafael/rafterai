We are going to choose 
our Ubuntu server, but any would do. We are going to do the following from this one server:

•	

Add peers to our cluster

•	 Create a volume directory on our brick

•	 Create a volume

We have named our hosts au-mel-dfs-1 to au-mel-dfs-3 and have added them to our DNS zone. The 

Ubuntu host has been assigned au-mel-dfs-3.
