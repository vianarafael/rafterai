A connection is then initiated on the client and connects to the server via TCP on port 22 (you can 
change this port, and we’ll talk about how to do that in Chapter 10).

 ■ Note 
 You have probably encountered Ip addresses and hostnames before, but you might not have come 
across ports. Ports are communications end points used by services like ssh.
