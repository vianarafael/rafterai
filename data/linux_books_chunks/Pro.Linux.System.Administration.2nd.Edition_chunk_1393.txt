We then brought up our enp0s9 device.

And just quickly, we can validate that our bonding driver has been loaded into the kernel by issuing the 

following again:

$ lsmod |grep bonding
bonding   136705  0

If we wanted to bring down the bond interface we could issue the following:

$ sudo nmcli connection down  bond0
Connection 'bond0' successfully deactivated (D-Bus active path: /org/freedesktop/
NetworkManager/ActiveConnection/6)

$ sudo nmcli device status
DEVICE  TYPE      STATE         CONNECTION
enp0s3  ethernet  connected     enp0s3
enp0s8  ethernet  disconnected  --
enp0s9  ethernet  disconnected  --

240

You can see here that bringing down the bond0 interface has disconnected the two slaves as well.
We can also view your new bonded device by issuing the /sbin/ip addr show command, which will 

produce the following output:

CHAPter 7 ■ NetworkiNg AND FirewAllS

If you look at the interface description of enp0s8 and enp0s9, you can see that they are both set to SLAVE, 
and you can see that bond0 is set to MASTER.
