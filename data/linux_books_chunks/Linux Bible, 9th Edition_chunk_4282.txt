However, a cipher with a key size of 256 bits or 512 bits is considered secure because it 
would take trillions of years to brute-force crack such a keyed cipher.

Symmetric key cryptography
Symmetric cryptography, also called secret key or private key cryptography, encrypts 
 plaintext using a single keyed cipher. The same key is needed in order to decrypt the data.
