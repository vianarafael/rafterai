The use of asymmetric encryption during the handshaking phase allows safe communica-
tion without the use of a preshared key, and the symmetric encryption is faster and more 
practical for use on the session data.

For the client to verify the identity of the server, the server must have a previously 
 generated private key, as well as a certiÔ¨Å cate containing the public key and information 
about the server.
