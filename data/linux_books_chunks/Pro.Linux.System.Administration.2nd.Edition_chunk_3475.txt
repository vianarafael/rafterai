We are now going to configure it 
to transport our mail from the MTA and into the usersâ€™ home directories. Dovecot allows us to use Sieve 
(http://sieve.info/) to filter what e-mail gets delivered to where for our users.

To use Dovecot, we are going to set an LMTP (Local Mail Transfer Protocol), which is a long-running 

process started by the Dovecot master process.
