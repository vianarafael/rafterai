To keep your familiar setup, you could 

add a user ubuntu either in the Preseed or in a SNIPPET at the end of the installation.

#d-i passwd/user-fullname string Ubuntu User
#d-i passwd/username string ubuntu

Firewall and Network

You can set up the network in whichever fashion suits you with Preseed, but you cannot do any firewall 
configurations.
