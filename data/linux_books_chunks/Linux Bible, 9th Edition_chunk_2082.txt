If fdisk cannot sync the partition table on the disk with the kernel, the most 
likely reason is that a partition from the disk is still mounted. Unmount the 
partition, and try running the following command to sync the disk partition table 
with the kernel:

# partprobe /dev/sdc

If partprobe does not work, rebooting the computer will make sure the disk and 
kernel are in sync.
