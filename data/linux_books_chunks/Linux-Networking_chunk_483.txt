So besides caching of internet
data (the original function of a proxy server) and besides firewall like restrictions based on
www content, a proxy server is in the perfect position to alter the webpages that you visit.

You could for instance change the advertising on a webpage (or remove certain advertisers),
or like we do in this example; change all images so they are upside down.

The server needs command line tools to manipulate images and a perl script that uses these
tools  (and  wget  to  download  the  images  locally  and  serve  them  with  apache2).
