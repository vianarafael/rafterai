For CentOS you will 
need to have the epel-release package installed as the Collectd packages arenâ€™t available in the standard 
repositories.

The Ubuntu version available from the standard Ubuntu repositories is slightly behind the current 
version, but the CentOS version is fairly recent; depending on the features you require, this may affect your 
install decisions.

Installation is simple.
