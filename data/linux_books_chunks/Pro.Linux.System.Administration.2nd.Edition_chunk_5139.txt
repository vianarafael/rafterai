This means that even if all the space on your disk is 
consumed, the system will not crash.

Testing Logging with logger
Present on both CentOS and Ubuntu, logger is a useful command-line tool to test your logging 
configuration.

$ logger -p mail.info "This is a test message for facility mail and priority info"

This would write the message “This is a test message for facility mail and priority info” to your rsyslog 

daemon and into whatever destination you have configured for messages with a facility of mail and a 
priority of info.

As you can see, the -p parameter allows you to specify a facility and priority combination, and then the 

test message is contained in quotation marks.

We often use logger inside bash scripts to generate multiple messages for testing purposes.
