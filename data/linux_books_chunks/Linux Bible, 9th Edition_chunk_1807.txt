You can check the RPM database to look for errors (yum check) or 
just rebuild the RPM database Ô¨Å les, as follows:

# yum check
check all
# yum clean rpmdb
Cleaning repos: rhel-7-server-rpms
4 rpmdb files removed

Of the yum clean examples in the preceding three command lines, all remove cached data 
from the /var/cache/yum subdirectories, except for the rpmdb example.
