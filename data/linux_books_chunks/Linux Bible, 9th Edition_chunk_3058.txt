The NCSA HTTP daemon was the most popular HTTP server at the time, but had 
started to show its age after its author, Rob McCool, left NCSA in mid-1994.

Another project that came from NCSA is Mosaic. Most modern web browsers can trace their origins to Mosaic.

In early 1995, a group of developers formed the Apache Group and began making extensive 
modiÔ¨Å cations to the NCSA HTTPD code base.
