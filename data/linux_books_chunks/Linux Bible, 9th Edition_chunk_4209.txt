To do this scan, use the find command.

In the example that follows, a scan is made of the /sbin directory. To see if any binary 
ﬁ les were modiﬁ ed less than 24 hours ago, the command find /sbin -mtime -1 is used. 
In the example, several ﬁ les display, showing they were modiﬁ ed recently. This indicates 
that malicious activity is taking place on the system.
