By changing the browseable option 
from no to yes, users can print to all printers (printable = yes).

You can also store Windows native print drivers on your Samba server. When a Windows 
client uses your printer, the driver automatically becomes available. You do not need to  
download a driver from the vendorâ€™s website.
