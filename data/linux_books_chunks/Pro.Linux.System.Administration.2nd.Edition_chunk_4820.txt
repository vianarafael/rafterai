one process creates two, two 
create two more, four leads to eight, and so on, thus starving other processes of resources such as CpU 
cycles and, eventually, ram.

Memory Usage
Another cause of reduced performance is excessive memory use. If a task starts using a lot of memory, 
the host will be forced to free up memory for it by putting other tasks into swap memory.
