We do that with the systemctl command 

like so, and then we can tail the logs that are produced by the service.

$ sudo systemctl start filebeat && tail â€“f /var/log/filebeat/filebeat

Now on the monitor host, we can start the logstash service, and we should see a rapid amount of data 

coming in from our Filebeat on the gateway server.

In Listing 18-15 we see the one of the captured log messages from the gateway host.
