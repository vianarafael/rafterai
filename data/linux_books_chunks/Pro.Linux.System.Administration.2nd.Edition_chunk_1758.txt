As you learned in that chapter, a host can be installed with 
a variety of different applications, ranging from a bare-bones installation to one with every application 
and tool installed. But this isn’t the end of the line for installing and managing applications. Once you’ve 
installed your host, you’ll often need to add applications, upgrade and patch them, and sometimes remove 
them.
