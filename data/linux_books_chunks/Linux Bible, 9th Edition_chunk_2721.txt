System initialization time is reduced by systemd because it can start services 
in a parallel manner.

Learning systemd basics
With the SysVinit daemon, services are stopped and started based upon runlevels. The 
 systemd is also concerned with runlevels, but they are called target units. Although 
the main job of systemd is to start services, it can manage other types of things called 
units.
