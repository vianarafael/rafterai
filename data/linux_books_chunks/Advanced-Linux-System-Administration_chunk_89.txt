Patching a Kernel

Incremental upgrades can be applied to an existing source tree. If you have downloaded 
the linux-2.4.21.tgz kernel source and you want to update to a more recent kernel linux-
2.4.22 for example, you must download the patch-2.4.22.gz patch.  

Applying the Patch

The patch file attempts to overwrite files in the 2.4.21 tree.
