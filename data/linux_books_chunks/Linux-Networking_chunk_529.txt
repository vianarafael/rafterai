fully qualified domain name

The fully qualified domain name or fqdn is the combination of the hostname of a machine
appended with its domain name.

If for example a system is called gwen and it is in the domain linux-training.be, then the
fqdn of this system is gwen.linux-training.be.

On Linux systems you can use the hostname and dnsdomainname commands to verify
this information.

root@gwen:~# hostname
gwen
root@gwen:~# dnsdomainname
linux-training.be
root@gwen:~# hostname --fqdn
gwen.linux-training.be
root@gwen:~# cat /etc/debian_version
