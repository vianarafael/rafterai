</VirtualHost>The SSL service is set to listen on standard SSL port 
   443 on all the system's network interfaces.

A VirtualHost block is created that causes error messages and access messages to be 
logged to log Ô¨Å les that are separate from the standard logs used by the server (ssl_
error_log and ssl_access_log in the /var/log/httpd/ directory).
