and launchers that together take up the space of only one icon. Click the drawer to show the 
applets and launchers as if they were being pulled out of a drawer icon on the panel.

To add a drawer to your panel, right-click the panel and select Add to Panel âžª Drawer. 
A drawer appears on the panel.
