Some of these targets are “special” targets like 

swap.target which is used to manage swap partitions and swap files and slices.target, which sets up all the 
CGroup slice units. The multiuser target is made up of all these other targets. If you look into the unit file for 
multiuser.target you will see that it Requires=basic.target. The basic.target has Requires=sysinit.target.
