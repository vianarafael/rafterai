a partition table 
holds information about the block addresses (in chunks of 512 bytes or 4KB of disk). the MBr can only 
hold 2tiBs worth of addresses while Gpt can hold 8-9ZiB.

Figure 6-1.  Your hard disk

a disk will either have a MBr at the start (in the first 512 bytes) or Gpt. if it has a MBr the partition 
table is written after the first 446 bytes of the disk.
