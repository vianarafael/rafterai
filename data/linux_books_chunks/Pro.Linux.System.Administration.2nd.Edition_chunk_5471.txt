To run Cobbler, you need to install the EPEL repositories.

$ sudo yum install –y epel-release

Then we need to install Cobbler.

$ sudo yum install –y cobbler

This will install some additional YUM utilities and the createrepo package, which assist in repository 

management. We’ve also installed some additional packages Cobbler uses: the DHCP daemon, a TFTP 
server, and the Apache web server.
