From our rpmdevtools package we use the rpmdev-newspec command as follows:

$ rpmdev-newspec simple_echo && mv simple_echo.spec SPECS/
simple_echo.spec created; type minimal, rpm version >= 4.11.

This has created our spec file and moved it into our SPECS directory. We can now use our vi editor to 

edit the file.
