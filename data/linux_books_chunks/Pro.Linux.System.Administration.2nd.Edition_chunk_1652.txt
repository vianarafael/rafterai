So reading the rules from top to bottom like the Netfilter firewall does, we are allowing 

SSH traffic, dropping invalid traffic, allowing any current and established traffic, then dropping everything 
else.

You can also flush your chains, which means removing all the rules from all the chains or all the rules 

from a specified chain.
