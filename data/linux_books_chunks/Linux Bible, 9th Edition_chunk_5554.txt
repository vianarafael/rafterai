Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically 
terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the 
third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copy-
right holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly 
and ﬁ nally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to 
notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the 
copyright holder notiﬁ es you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the ﬁ rst 
time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copy-
right holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties 
who have received copies or rights from you under this License.
