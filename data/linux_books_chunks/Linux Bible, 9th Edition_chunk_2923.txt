Likewise, if you sent 
a print job to the wrong printer, the Move Job selection can be useful. From the 
Administration tab, click Manage Jobs; then click Show Active Jobs to see what 
print jobs are currently in the queue for the printer. Select the Cancel Job button 
next to the print job you want to cancel, or select Move Job to move the print job 
to a different printer.
