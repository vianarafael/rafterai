To display 

the current connection information using nmcli we would issue the following:

$ sudo nmcli connection show
NAME        UUID                                     TYPE                DEVICE
enp0s3      da717740-45eb-4c45-b324-7d78006bb657     802-3-ethernet      enp0s3

There are several shortcuts for nmcli, like “c” for connection and “d” for device.
