You can do these things:

 ■ View the system from a console. Double-click a running VM in the virt- 

manager window. A console window opens to the VM, allowing you to use the VM 
just as you would from a physical console to access an operating system installed 
directly on the hardware.

 ■ Shut down the VM. Right-click the VM entry, and select Shut down.
