On the command line, you simply type yum and one of a number of potential 
actions, such as install, remove, or list, and then potentially the name of the package or packages on which 
you wish to take action, for example:

$ sudo yum install nmap

 â–  Note  You need root privileges to run the yum command, either by being signed in as the root user or making 
use of the sudo command.
