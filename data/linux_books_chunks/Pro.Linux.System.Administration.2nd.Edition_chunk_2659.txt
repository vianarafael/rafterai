For the master you will 
need to add the following to the /etc/bind/named.conf.options file.

listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; 192.168.0.1; };

On the slave you will need to add the following to the /etc/named.conf file:

listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; 192.168.0.254; };
...
allow-query     { localhost; 192.168.0.0/24; };

The next step is to tell the slave server where to find the master.
