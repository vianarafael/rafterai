Run a dd command to create a 1Gb file containing only zeroes in the 
background, while running vmstat simultaneously, as shown in Figure 17-5.

On the same host we will run the following command:

$ dd if=/dev/zero of=./largefile bs=1M count=1024

Then when we run the vmstat command at the same time, you will see something similar to Figure 17-5.
