You learn how simple scripts can be harnessed to a scheduling facility (such as cron 
or at) to simplify administrative tasks or just run on demand as they are needed.

Understanding Shell Scripts
Have you ever had a task that you needed to do over and over that took lots of typing on the 
 command line? Do you ever think to yourself, “Wow, I wish I could just type one command to do all 
this”? Maybe a shell script is what you’re after.

Shell scripts are the equivalent of batch ﬁ les in MS-DOS and can contain long lists of commands, 
complex ﬂ ow control, arithmetic evaluations, user-deﬁ ned variables, user-deﬁ ned functions, and 
sophisticated condition testing.
