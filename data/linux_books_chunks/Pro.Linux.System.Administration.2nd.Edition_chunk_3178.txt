Weâ€™ve specified the . marker, and the server has responded by saying 
that it has accepted the e-mail. Each e-mail is then submitted to a mail queue, processed, and sent on by 
your server.

You can now continue to send e-mails by repeating the MAIL FROM command, or you can disconnect 

from the server using the QUIT command.

QUIT
221 2.0.0 Bye

This is a simple scenario for sending e-mail.
