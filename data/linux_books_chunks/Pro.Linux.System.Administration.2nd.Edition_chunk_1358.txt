If we have NM_CONTROLLED=”no”, then 
ifup will use the ip command to manage the interface. Before doing so, it checks to see if this device is 
already managed by the NetworkManager and if so, it does not attempt to manage the device. To bring up 
the enp0s3 device you issue the following:

$ ifup enp0s3

Files like network-functions are scripts can that contain functions and variables.
