It does this by implementing OpenGL (http://opengl.org) accelerated 
effects using the Mesa (http://www.mesa3d.org) open source OpenGL implementation.

Currently, AIGLX supports a limited set of video cards and implements only a few 3D 
effects, but it does offer some insight into the eye candy that is in the works.

If your video card was properly detected and conÔ¨Å gured, you may be able to simply turn 
on the Desktop Effects feature to see the effects that have been implemented so far.
