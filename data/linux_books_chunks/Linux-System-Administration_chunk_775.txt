cron.allow and cron.deny

The cron daemon crond is reading the cron tables, taking into account the /etc/cron.allow
and /etc/cron.deny files.

These files work in the same way as at.allow and at.deny. When the cron.allow file exists,
then your username has to be in it, otherwise you cannot use cron.
