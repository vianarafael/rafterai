The ecryptfs utility 
is not a ﬁ lesystem type as the name would imply. Instead, it is a POSIX-compliant utility 
that allows you to create an encryption layer on top of any ﬁ lesystem.

The ecryptfs utility is not installed by default on Fedora and RHEL. To install that util-
ity, you must use the command yum install ecryptfs-utils.
