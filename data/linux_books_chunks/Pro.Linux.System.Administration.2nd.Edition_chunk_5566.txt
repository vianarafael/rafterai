Any prerun script is specified at the 
end of the Kickstart file and prefixed with the line %pre.

Each %post and %pre section must have a corresponding %end.
The postrun scripts are triggered after your configuration is complete and your host is installed. They 

should also be specified at the end of the Kickstart file and prefixed by a %post line.
