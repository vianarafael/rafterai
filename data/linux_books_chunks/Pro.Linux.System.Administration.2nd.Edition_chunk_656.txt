That would make the regular expression look as follows:

"\b[A-Za-z0-9._-]+@example.com\b"

and now if we run the grep over our text file example we only match on the e-mail addresses we are 
after:

$ egrep -o "\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@example.com\b" file.txt
root@example.com
jsmith@example.com
bjuice@example.com

The grep command with regular expressions can be very powerful and you can do some very complex 
expressions, but remember the old joke:

â€œI solved my problem with a regular expression .
