The BIOS uses the special section on your hard drive, the master boot record.

When we installed our operating system our installation installed a boot loader called GRUB2. This 
stands for GRand Unified Bootloader (2) and its job is to launch itself, then find, load, and hand off to your 
operating system. It does this in two stages, the purpose of the first stage is to load the second stage.
