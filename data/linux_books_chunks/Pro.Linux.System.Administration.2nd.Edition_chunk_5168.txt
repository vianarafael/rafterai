They can detect the relationships between that data and either put those pieces 
together into a coherent whole or provide you with the right pieces to allow you to put that analysis together 
for yourself.

you can rely on them to tell you that something is wrong and that you need to intervene.

The first stage of building such an automated log-monitoring system is to make sure you are collecting 

the right things and putting them in the right place.
