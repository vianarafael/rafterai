Direct host or address lookups can be 
done via the host utility.

 â–  Note  You may be used to using the deprecated nslookup utility. the host command is its replacement.

You pass the hostname or address you want to look up and optionally the DNS server you want to 
query, as shown in Listing 10-8.
