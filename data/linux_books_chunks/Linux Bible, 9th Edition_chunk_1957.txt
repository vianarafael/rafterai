For example:

11

[mary]$ chmod 644 /tmp/memo.txt
[mary]$ getfacl /tmp/memo.txt
# file: tmp/memo.txt
# owner: mary
# group: mary
user::rw-
user:bill:rw-   #effective:r--
group::rw-      #effective:r--
group:sales:rw- #effective:r--
mask::r--
other::r--

Notice in the preceding example that even though the user bill and group sales have rw- 
permissions, their effective permissions are r--.
