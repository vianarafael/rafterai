it does this in the following manner:

• 

• 

• 

• 

checking for the service unit file in the systemd directory paths

if it can’t find one, it looks in /etc/init.d/ for a service file without the .service 
suffix

if it finds one it uses the systemd-sysv-generator to convert it to a systemd unit file

it uses the LSB runlevels to decide which target it needs to be executed in.

When we have Sysv init (LSB compliant) files in /etc/init.d/ and we start the service using the 
systemctl command, Systemd will find those files and then run them through a generator (systemd-
sysv-generator).
