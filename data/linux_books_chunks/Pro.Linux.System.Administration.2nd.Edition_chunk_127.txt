The LVM software allows the administrator to change the disk layout, add new disk storage, 
or remove and repurpose disk storage to another part of the system without having to rebuild the system and 
reformat the underlying disks. Btrfs is also available and is a new-ish CoW (Copy-on-Write) filesystem. Like 
LVM it allows you to group your storage in a flexible way.
