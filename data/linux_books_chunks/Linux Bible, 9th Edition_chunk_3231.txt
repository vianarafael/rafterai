By default, httpd is run by the apache user and group. Make sure the account 
has execute permissions on the directory and every directory above it, as well as 
read permissions on the ﬁ les themselves. Read permissions on a directory are also 
 necessary if you want Apache to generate an index of ﬁ les.
