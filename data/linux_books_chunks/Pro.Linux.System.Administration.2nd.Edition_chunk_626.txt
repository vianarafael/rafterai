Using date on the command line without any options will return the current time and date 
as follows:

$ date
Tue Aug 19 13:01:20 EST 2016

You can also add switches to the date command to format the output into different date or time format; 

for example, to display Unix epoch time (the number of seconds since January 1, 1970), you would execute 
the date command as follows:

$ date +%s
1219116319

131

Here we’ve used the + symbol to add a format and then specified the format, in this case %s, to display 

epoch time.
