To do most administrative tasks, you need to be logged in as the 
root user (also called the superuser) or to temporarily get root permission (usually using the sudo 
command). Regular users who don’t have root permission cannot change, or in some cases even see, 
some of the conﬁ guration information for a Linux system.
