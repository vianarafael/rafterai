Consider the following examples of using alias from a bash shell:

$ alias p='pwd ; ls –CF'
$ alias rm='rm -i'

In the ﬁ rst example, the letter p is assigned to run the command pwd, and then to run ls 
-CF to print the current working directory and list its contents in column form. The 
second example runs the rm command with the -i option each time you type rm.
