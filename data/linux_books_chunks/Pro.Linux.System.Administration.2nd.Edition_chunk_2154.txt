Specify the -h option 

to display sizes in human readable form.

$ sudo free -h
         total       used     free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:     992M        520M     62M       12M     409M         321M
Swap:    3.0G        0B       3.0G

Alternatively, you can use the swapon command:

$ swapon â€“s
Filename        Type               Size           Used        Priority
/dev/dm-1       partition          3145728000        0              -1

The command reports a total of 3.0 G of swap space, which is the original 1 G we already had plus the 

2 G we just added.
