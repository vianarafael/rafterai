these are stored in the name server as rrsIG records.

the public key of the zone signing key pair is called the DnsKeY and it is published as a record on the name 
server too. the DnsKeY is used to validate the rrsIG signature to verify the authenticity of the rrset.

however, we now need to validate the DnsKeY; how do we know it is the real one? for that we have a 
key signing key pair.
