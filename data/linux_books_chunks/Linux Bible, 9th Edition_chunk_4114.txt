The passwords were 
hashed. A hashed password is created using a one-way mathematical process. After you 
create the hash, you cannot re-create the original characters from the hash. Hereâ€™s how it 
works. 

When a user enters the account password, the Linux system rehashes the password and 
then compares the hash result to the original hash in /etc/passwd.
