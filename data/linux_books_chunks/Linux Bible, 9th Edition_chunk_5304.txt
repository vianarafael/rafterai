To attempt to reload the cups daemon on your Linux server, use the following:

 ■ For SysVinit:

# service cups reload
Reloading cups:            [  OK  ]

 ■ For Upstart:

# initctl reload cups

Remember that if a service has not yet been ported to Upstart, you need to use the 
service command instead of initctl.

 ■ For systemd, this is a trick question.
