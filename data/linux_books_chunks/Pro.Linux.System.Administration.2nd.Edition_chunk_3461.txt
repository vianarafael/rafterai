Lastly, the ${recipient} option contains the recipient of the e-mail 
so Postfix knows to whom to send the e-mail.

Testing SpamAssassin

To test SpamAssassin, let’s send an e-mail using the swaks tool, an e-mail testing tool that can be installed 
via the package manager, and examine the results.

$ swaks -tls -a -au ataylor -ap password -t jsmith@example.com -f 
ataylor@example.com --body /usr/share/doc/spamassassin-3.4.0/sample-spam.txt

This command connects to your mail server and sends an e-mail to the user jsmith@example.com from 

the SASL-authenticated user ataylor.
