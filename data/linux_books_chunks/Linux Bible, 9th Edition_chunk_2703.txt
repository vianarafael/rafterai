A service, on the other hand, is a long-running program that never Ô¨Å nishes its 
work or self-terminates, but instead stays in a running state. A daemon is an example of an 
Upstart service job.

The example that follows shows several Upstart jobs that include both task and service 
jobs. The task jobs are in a stop/waiting state, such as the task rc.
