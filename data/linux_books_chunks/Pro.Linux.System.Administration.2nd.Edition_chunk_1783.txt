We will talk a little bit about spec files and how to build your 
own packages later in this chapter.

The rpm tool provides the basic package management tasks like installing and removing packages, but 
it doesn’t handle a variety of other tasks, such as retrieving dependency packages (i.e., packages you need 
to install alongside, or prior to, a particular package installation) from online repositories or the regular 
automation of package updates.

 ■ Note  having worked with Linux for a long time, we can attest that managing a Linux system is now much 
easier thanks to smart package management.
