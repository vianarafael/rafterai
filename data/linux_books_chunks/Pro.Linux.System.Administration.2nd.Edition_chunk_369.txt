Without going too deep 

into the Ruby language here you may be able to see that we can write blocks of code between do and end 
statements. We pass the result of Vagrant.configure(2) to the config variable object. We can then use that 
to assign our Vagrant configuration. In Figure 3-4 we are setting config.vm.box to equal ”base.”

 ruby is a great flexible programming language.
