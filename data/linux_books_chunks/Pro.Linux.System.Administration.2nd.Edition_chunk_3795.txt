To do that, we are going 
install its YUM repository for GlusterFS version 3.7.x like so:

$ sudo yum install centos-release-gluster37
$ sudo yum install â€“y glusterfs-server

For Ubuntu, we are going to add the Gluster team PPA (this PPA, or Personal Package Archive, is not 
directly associated with Gluster but a group of Ubuntu maintainers).
