If youâ€™re testing Linux with a LiveCD, you may see a default username and password 
that you will be prompted to log in with, or you may even be automatically logged in. For example, the 
Ubuntu LiveCD has a default username of ubuntu with a password of ubuntu, and it usually automatically 
logs you in.
