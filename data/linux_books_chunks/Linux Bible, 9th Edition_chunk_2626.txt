You can lock down the IP addresses of the 
machines in your home by attaching MAC addresses of each computer’s network interface 
card to speciﬁ c IP addresses on a DHCP server, and then mapping those names to addresses 
in a DNS server.

Before you create a public DNS server, keep in mind that it is very important to secure your DNS server properly.
