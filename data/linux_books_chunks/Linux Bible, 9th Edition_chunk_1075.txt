You may 
be used to a graphical environment in which you have lots of programs active at the 
same time so you can switch among them as needed. This shell thing can seem pretty

Although the bash shell doesnâ€™t include a GUI for running many programs at once, it does 
let you move active programs between the background and foreground.
