Also, the process ID 
(PID) number is given for the daemon.

Checking services for Upstart systems
To see all the services running on a Linux server using the Upstart init daemon, use the 
following command:

# initctl list | grep start/running
tty (/dev/tty3) start/running, process 1163
...
system-setup-keyboard start/running, process 656
prefdm start/running, process 1154

Keep in mind that there may still be services that have not been ported to the Upstart 
init daemon.
