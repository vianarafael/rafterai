You can see we’ve adjusted the template in Listing 19-1 to reflect the DHCP configuration we 
used in Chapter 10. We’ve added two settings.

allow booting;
allow bootp;

These two options tell the DHCP server to respond to queries from hosts who request network boots.
The other two important settings to note in Listing 19-1 are next-server and filename configuration 
options.
