However, as shown in the example that follows, the service is successfully started 
when a restart is attempted.

# service cups stop
Stopping cups:           [  OK  ]
# service cups restart
Stopping cups:           [FAILED]
Starting cups:           [  OK  ]
# service cups status
cupsd (pid 8236) is running...

Reloading a service is different from restarting a service.
