To store information used by a shell script in such a way that it can be easily 
reused, you can set variables. Variable names within shell scripts are case-sensitive and can 
be deﬁ ned in the following manner:

NAME=value

The ﬁ rst part of a variable is the variable name, and the second part is the value set for 
that name.
