Let’s replace that rule with the correct one (don’t worry, we are going to explain what the conntrack does 
shortly).

sudo iptables -R IPV4-INCOMING 2 -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID -j DROP
1  ACCEPT   tcp -- anywhere  anywhere  tcp   dpt:ssh
2  DROP    all -- anywhere  anywhere  ctstate INVALID
3  ACCEPT   all -- anywhere  anywhere  ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED
4  DROP    all -- anywhere  anywhere

That looks better.
