We will make a few assumptions here:

•	

•	

•	

You are using a CentOS ISO from the CentOS web site (www.centos.org/download/ 
and you have burned it onto a CD/DVD/USB.

You are building just a basic mail, DNS (Domain Name System), and web server.

You are installing on a fresh server without any previous operating system.

First, put your installation media (usually a CD, DVD, or USB) into your host and power it on.

If you were building a virtual machine, you’d build instead from the raw ISO.
