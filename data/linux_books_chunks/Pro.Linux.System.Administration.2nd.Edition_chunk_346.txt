On Windows machines you can run commands from the 
cmd.exe program, from PowerShell, or from Git Bash like we just installed.

 â–  Tip 
 there are some things that you cannot natively do in the Windows command or powerShell console. 
one of the them is SSh. SSh is a secure way to access consoles over a network. By installing git Bash we get 
access to an SSh client.
