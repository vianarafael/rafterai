On other systems, you can ﬁ nd 
the location by looking for the ErrorLog directive in your Apache conﬁ guration.

You might encounter an error message that looks something like this:

[crit] (98)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to 
   port 80

This error often indicates that something else is bound to port 80 (not very common unless 
you have attempted to install another web server), that another Apache process is already 
running (apachectl usually catches this), or that you have told Apache to bind the same 
IP address and port combination in more than one place.
