We are not going add the .htaccess 
directive; we are going to add our authentication at the directory level in the virtual host config.

    <Directory /var/www/html/www.example.com/uploads>
        Options -Indexes -FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
        AuthType Basic
        AuthName "Restricted Uploads"
        AuthBasicProvider file
        AuthUserFile "/opt/apache/www.example.com/passwords"
        Require valid-user
</Directory>

First, we specify the authentication type we want to use via the AuthType directive, which in our 
case is basic.
