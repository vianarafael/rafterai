This file
contains a list of http or ftp sources where packages for the distribution can be downloaded.

This is what that list looks like on my Debian server.

root@debian6:~# cat /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://ftp.be.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main
deb-src http://ftp.be.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main

deb http://security.debian.org/ squeeze/updates main
deb-src http://security.debian.org/ squeeze/updates main

# squeeze-updates, previously known as 'volatile'
deb http://ftp.be.debian.org/debian/ squeeze-updates main
deb-src http://ftp.be.debian.org/debian/ squeeze-updates main

On my Ubuntu there are four times as many online repositories in use.

root@ubu1204~# wc -l /etc/apt/sources.list
63 /etc/apt/sources.list

There is much more to learn about apt, explore commands like add-apt-repository, apt-
key and apropos apt.
