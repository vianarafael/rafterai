AT&T, which owned the UNIX trademark 
originally, eventually made UNIX into a commercial product, but by that time, many of 
the concepts (and even much of the early code) that made UNIX special had fallen into the 
 public domain.

If you are not old enough to remember when AT&T split up in 1984, you may not remember 
a time when AT&T was “the” phone company.
