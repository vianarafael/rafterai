We can reserve some of our 100 addresses for this purpose 
by defining address pools. Weâ€™ll first define a pool for hosts the DHCP server knows about. Again, these pool 
definitions go within the subnet block.

subnet ... {
    ...
    pool {
        range 192.168.0.101 192.168.0.150;
        deny unknown clients
    }
}

This reserves 50 addresses for use with hosts that need a static assignment.
