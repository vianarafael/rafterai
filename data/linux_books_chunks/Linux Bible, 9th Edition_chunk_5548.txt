If additional permissions apply only to part 
of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire 
Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional 
permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.
