To add the script based on the chkconfig line in the service script, type the 

following:

# chkconfig --add My_New_Service
# ls /etc/rc?.d/*My_New_Service
/etc/rc0.d/K10My_New_Service  /etc/rc4.d/S25My_New_Service
/etc/rc1.d/K10My_New_Service  /etc/rc5.d/S25My_New_Service
/etc/rc2.d/S25My_New_Service  /etc/rc6.d/K10My_New_Service
/etc/rc3.d/S25My_New_Service

Based on the previous example (chkconfig: 2345 25 10), symbolic links to the script 
set the service to start in the position 25 (S25) for runlevels 2, 3, 4, and 5.
