Then you can use the process ID of that process as an option to the kill command, along 
with the signal you want to send.

For example, you run the top command and see that the bigcommand process is consum-
ing most of your processing power:

  PID USER   PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
10432 chris  20   0  471m 121m  18m S 99.9  3.2  77:01.76 bigcommand

Here, the bigcommand process is consuming 99.9 percent of the CPU.
