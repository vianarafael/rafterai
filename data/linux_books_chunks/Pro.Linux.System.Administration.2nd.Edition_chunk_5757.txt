The output has again been shortened, but you can see that we have 
"change": true, which means that the task was executed on the system and the system was changed.

What happens if we run that ansible task again?

$ ansible -c local localhost --become -m apt -a 'name=nginx state=latest update_cache=yes'
localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "cache_update_time": 1481951681,
    "cache_updated": true,
    "changed": false
}

Again, we are successful but this time, because Nginx is already install there was nothing to change, so 

"changed" is false.
