The screenshot
shows how to present the SCSI Disk device to LVM.

root@RHEL4:~# pvcreate /dev/sdc
Physical volume "/dev/sdc" successfully created

Note: lvm will work fine when using the complete device, but another operating system on the
same computer (or on the same SAN) will not recognize lvm and will mark the block device
as being empty! You can avoid this by creating a partition that spans the whole device, then
run pvcreate on the partition instead of the disk.

Then vgcreate creates a volume group using one device.
