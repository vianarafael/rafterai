In small 
startups and home networks it is common to name hosts after favorite TV characters, bands, or mythical 
creatures. While this is fun, it soon becomes annoying when you have multiple hosts in multiple geographical 
locations doing particular jobs. Plus you have used all your favorite characters first and it becomes really hard 
when you have to kill off your “pet” server.
