For 
example, the mount command has permissions set as -rwsr-xr-x. This allows any 
user to run mount to list mounted ﬁ lesystems (although you still have to be root to 
use mount to actually mount ﬁ lesystems from the command line, in most cases).

 ■ If a t appears at the end of a directory, it indicates that the sticky bit is set for that 
directory (for example, drwxrwxr-t).
