Running Jobs:

 JobId Level   Name                       Status
============================================================
     1 Full    headoffice.example.com.2016-10-10_01.21.34_04 is running

From that status you can see that we have a job ID of 1 and that we are running a full backup, since we 
do not have a full backup yet.
