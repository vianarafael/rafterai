If a license document contains a further restriction but permits 
relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material gov-
erned by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not 
survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the rel-
evant source ﬁ les, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those ﬁ les, or a notice 
indicating where to ﬁ nd the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately 
written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.
