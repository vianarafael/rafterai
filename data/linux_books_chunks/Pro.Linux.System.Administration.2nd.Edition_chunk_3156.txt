In this chapter, we’ll briefly explain how e-mail works, and we’ll introduce you 
to the component parts of an e-mail solution, including

•	 Mail transfer agents (MTAs): The servers that send and receive e-mail

•	 Mail user agents (MUAs): Clients through which your users send and receive e-mail

•	 Mail delivery agents (MDAs): Tools that help you deliver e-mail to mailboxes

We’ll also introduce you to these applications to perform these functions:

•	

Postfix: A Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) e-mail server

•	 Dovecot: An IMAP and a POP3 server

The Postfix e-mail server will allow your users to send and receive e-mail both from internal users and 

externally, such as from the Internet.
