Duplicity is a program 
that uses rsync, and rsync can sync large amounts of data. Around the world rsync has been used by many 
companies as their remote backup strategy successfully. rsync by itself is great at syncing, but it does not 
easily manage discrete backups. Duplicity manages discrete backups effectively, but it can have many 
options to choose from.
