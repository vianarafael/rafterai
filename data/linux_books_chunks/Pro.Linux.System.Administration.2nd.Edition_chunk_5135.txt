The last line tells rsyslogd to 
run a TCP server on port 6514.

Now we will need to make sure that port 6514 is open on our backup server, which is a CentOS server, so 

we use the firewall-cmd command.

$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone public --add-port=6514/tcp
$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload

Then we restart the rsyslog daemon on the backup server too.

$ sudo systemctl restart rsyslog

On the backup server we can now inspect our /var/log/messages file, and we should see logs similar to 

these:

Dec  1 12:01:17 gateway chronyd[608]: Selected source 27.124.125.250
Dec  1 12:01:19 gateway chronyd[608]: Selected source 27.124.125.250
Dec  1 12:01:21 backup systemd: Starting user-0.slice.

Dec  1 12:08:22 dc1 systemd[1]: Started CUPS Scheduler.

The logs are coming in with the timestamp, hostname, service, and message being written.
