On Ubuntu, the 
name server is started automatically when it is installed, but if it were not running we could start it via sudo 
service bind9 start.

So that our new DNS server can be queried, we need to ensure the firewall is not blocking traffic. DNS 

defaults to using the UDP protocol on port number 53, but it will switch to the TCP if responses contain a 
large amount of data.
