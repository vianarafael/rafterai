The mode, user, and 
group options control the permissions and ownership of the socket that we restrict to just the postfix user.

When the Dovecot daemon is running, you can see this file in the directory.

$ sudo ls -l /var/spool/postfix/private/auth
srw-rw----. 1 postfix postfix 0 Aug 25 09:33 /var/spool/postfix/private/auth

Next we have to change a setting in /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-auth.conf.
