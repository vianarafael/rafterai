The -out option specifies the signed 
certificate we’re going to output, and the -infiles option specifies the CSR we want to sign (we’ve assumed 
our CSR file is in the /root directory).

 ■ Tip 

 You can see the other options available with the openssl ca command by entering man ca.

You will be prompted for the passphrase you created for the CA’s private key, then the details of your 
certificate will be displayed, and finally you will be prompted to sign the certificate and write its details to the 
CA’s database.
