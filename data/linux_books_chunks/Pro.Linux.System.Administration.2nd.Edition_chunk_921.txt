The command works much like the RunAs command in 
Microsoft Windows that allows a user to run a command as another user.

 â–  Note 
 another command called su, also known as substitute user or switch user, allows you to open a 
subshell as a specific user. It is commonly used to change to the root user to perform some action. You can 
read about it through its man page.
