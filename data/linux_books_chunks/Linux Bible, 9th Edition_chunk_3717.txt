You use the umount command 
with either the local mount point or the remote Ô¨Å lesystem name. For example, here are two 
ways you could unmount maple:/stuff from the local directory /mnt/maple:

# umount maple:/stuff
# umount /mnt/maple

Either form works. If maple:/stuff is mounted automatically (from a listing in 
/etc/fstab), the directory is remounted the next time you boot Linux.
