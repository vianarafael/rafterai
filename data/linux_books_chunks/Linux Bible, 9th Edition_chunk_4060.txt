Using sudo provides the following 
security beneﬁ ts:

 ■ The root password does not have to be given out.

 ■ You can ﬁ ne-tune command access.

 ■ All sudo use (who, what, when) is recorded in /var/log/secure.

All failed sudo access attempts are logged.

After you grant someone sudo permission, you can try to restrict root access to certain com-
mands in the /etc/sudoers ﬁ le (with the visudo command).
