This can be done 
in a number of different ways, including using a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) 
 third-party tool such as TrueCrypt (www.truecrypt.org) or Linux Uniﬁ ed Key Setup 
(LUKS) (https://code.google.com/p/cryptsetup/).

One of your options in Linux is to encrypt your root partition upon installation (see 
Chapter 9, “Installing Linux”).
