In the middle are rules that open 
ports for service requests you have already allowed, such as the secure shell service (sshd 
on TCP port 22). At the end of the rules, a Ô¨Å nal rule usually DROPs or REJECTs any request 
that has not explicitly been allowed.

To allow public access to someone requesting your FTP server, you want to allow new 
requests to TCP port 21.
