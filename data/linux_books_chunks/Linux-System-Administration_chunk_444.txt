jbod

jbod uses two or more disks, and is often called concatenating (spanning, spanned set, or
spanned volume). Data is written to the first disk, until it is full. Then data is written to the
second disk... The main advantage of jbod (Just a Bunch of Disks) is that you can create
larger drives. JBOD offers no redundancy.
