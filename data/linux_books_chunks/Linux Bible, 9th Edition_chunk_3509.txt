Setting it to %S substitutes the 
current service name, which allows any valid users of the service. You can also limit user 
access by indicating that only a particular workgroup (domain) name can be used to match 
users requesting this service.

If, after starting the smb service, you cannot log in using a valid user account, you may 
need to change some security features on your system.
