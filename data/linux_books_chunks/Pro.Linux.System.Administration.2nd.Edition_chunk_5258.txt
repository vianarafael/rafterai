FigureÂ 18-6 shows the search interface of Kibana. The default view here is the last 15 minutes of our log 

events. In the top left we can see how many events we can search over (14,094 hits). Just below that is the 
search bar where we can enter our search queries. Currently, the * means we are searching (and displaying) 
all 14,094 events.
