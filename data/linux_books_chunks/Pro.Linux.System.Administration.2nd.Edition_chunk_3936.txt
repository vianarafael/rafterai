When we log on to 
our remote host with our SSH key, this script will be called, which allows only one command to be executed 
by anyone with this key.

You can limit what SSH can do by adding some options to the authorized_keys file. authorized_keys 

is a file in the .ssh directory of the user on the remote host that holds copies of the public keys authorized to 
make connections to our host.
