Services are persistent, like a mail server, 
and tasks perform a function and then exit to a waiting state, like a backup program. An abstract job runs 
forever but has no child process. The definition files (or Upstart scripts) for jobs can be found under the /
etc/init directory.

Listing 6-9 illustrates what is called a system job definition for the rsyslogd daemon.
