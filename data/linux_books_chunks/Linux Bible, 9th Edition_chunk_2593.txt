You can start with one bonding ﬁ le (for example, ifcfg-bond0), and then point multiple 
ifcfg-eth? ﬁ les at that bond interface. Then you can load the bond module.

Depending on the type of bonding you want to do, you can set your bonding interface 
to different modes. Using the BONDING_OPTS variable, you deﬁ ne the mode and other 
bonding options (all of which are passed to the bonding module).
