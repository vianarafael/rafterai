These fields specify how and 
where each filesystem is mounted, and what to do if a check is to be performed. All lines starting with a hash 
mark (#) are comments.

The filesystem field contains the device node name of the filesystem you want to be mounted. You can 
also substitute a filesystem label by specifying LABEL=label or the filesystem UUID, as in the example.
