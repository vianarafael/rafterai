Without the -a, current date/time stamps are 
used and permissions are determined by your unmask.

The cp command typically also is aliased with the -i option, to prevent you from inadver-
tently overwriting Ô¨Å les.

As with the cp and mv commands, rm is also usually aliased to include the -i option. This 
can prevent the damage that can come from an inadvertent recursive remove (-r) option.
