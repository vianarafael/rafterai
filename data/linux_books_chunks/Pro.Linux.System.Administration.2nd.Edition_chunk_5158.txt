You can run scripts using the prerotate command, which runs the script prior to 

rotating any logs, or using postrotate, which runs the script after rotating the log file (or log files).

Listing 18-13 shows a script that restarts the rsyslog daemon after the log file (or log files) has been 

rotated.
