NTP servers provide synchronization services to a client that connects 
to them, and they also synchronize themselves with upstream time servers. The layers in this model are 
called strata, with the highest level, stratum 0, consisting of dedicated time hardware such as atomic clocks 
or satellite receivers. Servers connected to these stratum 0 time sources are called stratum 1 servers.
