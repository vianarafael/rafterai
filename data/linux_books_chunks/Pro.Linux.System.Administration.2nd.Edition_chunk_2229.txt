Type cd and the ~ shortcut for your home 
directory, and then check /mnt/data again using lsof.

$ cd ~
$ lsof /mnt/data

This time the lsof command has returned no open files and directories, and as the directory is no 

longer listed as in use, you can now safely unmount it:

$ sudo umount /mnt/data

 â–  Note  Unmounting a filesystem properly will set the Filesystem state flag you saw in the tune2fs output 
to clean, because it will ask the kernel to process the entire journal file and make sure all data is written to the 
disk.
