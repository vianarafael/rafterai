We 

removed the README (and saved it to a file bucket; see https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/man/

We can now test that the Apache service is up and running with the following command:

$ curl -I  http://localhost
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 21 Dec 2016 13:07:46 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.6 (CentOS)
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8

Every subsequent run of the Puppet agent will make sure the node stays in its current configuration.
