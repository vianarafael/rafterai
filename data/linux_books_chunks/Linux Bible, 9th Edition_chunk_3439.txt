Simply open 
the Firewall Conﬁ guration window, and select the check boxes next to the samba and 
samba-client entries on the public zone, Services tab. Those ports become immediately 
accessible (no restart of the firewalld service is required).

For earlier Fedora and RHEL systems that use iptables directly instead of the firewalld 
service, opening the ﬁ rewall is a more manual process.
