Make sure the following are in place:

 ■ Shared networked storage among the hypervisors

 ■ The same network interfaces conﬁ gured on each hypervisor

 ■ Compatible CPUs between hypervisors (Often, a set of hypervisors have the 

exact same hardware.)

 ■ A fast network connection between the hypervisors and storage

 ■ The same or similar versions of virtualization software on the hypervisors (In our 

case, we used Fedora 21 on both and installed them similarly.)

With all that in place, live migration requires only a few steps to get going.

Step 1: Identify other hypervisors

hypervisors, go to that window and do the following to connect to the other hypervisor:
