We cannot have virtual alias domains and virtual mailbox domains for the 
same domains, so it is either one or the other.

To set up virtual mailbox domains, we will need to set the following:

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
mydestination = localhost
virtual_mailbox_domains = hash:/etc/postfix/virt_domains
virtual_mailbox_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virt_mailbox
virtual_alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual
virtual_transport = lmtp:unix:private/dovecot-lmtp

In the previous example, we have reset the mydestination option to localhost, and we get our list of 

destinations from the virtual_mailbox_domains setting.
