Letâ€™s do that now.

/etc/bareos/bareos-dir.conf
Storage {
  Name = Gluster
  Address = backup.example.com                # N.B. Use a fully qualified name here
  Password = "4ncvx7V+Mw4NOMDMyuYjCHsNg1nKgcdh8nl0szWpi6t4"
  Device = GlusterStorage
  Media Type = GlusterFile
  Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 10
}

This maps the directory storage to the device storage file.
