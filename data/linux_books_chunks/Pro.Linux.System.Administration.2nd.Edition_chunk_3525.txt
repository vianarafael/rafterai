Rather than a cron 
job on Ubuntu, the FreshClam service is run as a daemon and will try to download any available signatures 
several times per day.

On both CentOS and Ubuntu, running the ClamAV daemon will create a Unix socket file. This special 
type of file is used by the ClamAV milter to communicate with the antivirus scanner.
