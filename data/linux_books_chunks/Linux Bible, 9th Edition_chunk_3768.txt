By modifying the boot order, you can tell the 
computer to temporarily ignore the default boot order and try to boot from the 
device you select.

For my Dell workstation, after I see the BIOS screen, I immediately press the F2 function 
key to go to into Setup or F12 to temporarily change the boot order.
