The nfsd man page 
describes options you can pass to the rpc.nfsd server daemon, which lets you do such 
things as run the server in debugging mode.

Man pages on the client side include the mount.nfs man page (to see what mount options 
you can use when mounting remote NFS directories on your local system).
