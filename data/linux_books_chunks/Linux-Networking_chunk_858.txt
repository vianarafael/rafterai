share section in smb.conf

There are two parameters to make a share writable. We can use read only or writable. This
example shows how to use writable to give write access to a share.

writable = yes

And this is an example of using the read only parameter to give write access to a share.

read only = no

18.3. configure the share

Then we simply add a share to our file server by editing smb.conf.
