To provide lookups for addresses, a special domain 
named in-addr.arpa. is used. This is essentially the root zone for reverse mappings.

Just like forward zones, you prepend the parts of your network address to this zone, with the most 
significant parts to the right. For our network of 192.168.0.x, this results in a 0.168.192.in-addr.arpa. reverse 
zone name.
