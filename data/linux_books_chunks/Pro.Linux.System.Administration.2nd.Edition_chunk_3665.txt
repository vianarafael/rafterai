For Samba to act as a domain controller, it must respond to the 
following text record requests:

$ host -t SRV _ldap._tcp.samba.example.com.
_ldap._tcp.samba.example.com has SRV record 0 100 389 dc1.samba.example.com.
$ host -t SRV _kerberos._udp.samba.example.com.
_kerberos._udp.samba.example.com has SRV record 0 100 88 dc1.samba.example.com.
$ host -t A dc1.samba.example.com.
dc1.samba.example.com has address 192.168.0.10

Here we have tested that we can resolve the LDAP service record, the Kerberos service record, and the 
A record for dc1.samba.example.com.
