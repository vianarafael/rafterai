There is a template file available 

on most distributions. This file, called openssl.cnf, is located in the /etc/pki/tls/ directory on CentOS 
distributions and in the /etc/ssl/ directory on Ubuntu.

If you are using a nonstandard directory for your CA or have some other settings, you can make a copy 
of this file and edit it in your CA directory.
