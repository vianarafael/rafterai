Here documents 
involve entering two less-than characters (<<) after a command, followed by a word. All 
typing following that word is taken as user input until the word is repeated on a line by 
itself. Here is an example:

$ mail root cnegus rjones bdecker <<thetext
> I want to tell everyone that there will be a 10 a.m.
> meeting in conference room B.
