Each time a page is displayed, you will be prompted as to how youâ€™d like to proceed. We run less by 
specifying the name of the file as follows:

$ less /etc/services

From inside the less interface, you can scroll through the file. To go to the next page, you use the 
spacebar, and to advance one line at a time, you use the Enter key. To scroll backward, you can use the B 
key.
