The Job Definition for Bareos Backup Service

Job {
   Name = ldap.example.com
   Client = ldap-fd
   Enabled = yes
   JobDefs = "DefaultLinux"
   Client Run Before Job = "/usr/local/bin/ldap_backup start"
   Client Run After Job = "/usr/local/bin/ldap_backup stop"
}

This is based on the proviso that you have your LDAP backup script installed in /usr/local/bin on 

your ldap.example.com host.

Restoring your LDAP database is then simply a matter of restoring the file on your host and running the 

slapadd command with the following parameters (OpenLDAP should be shut down for this process):

$ slapadd -b dc=example,dc=com -F /etc/ldap/slapd.d -l restored.ldif.backup.file

Here we have restored our LDAP database to how it was when we performed the last save.
