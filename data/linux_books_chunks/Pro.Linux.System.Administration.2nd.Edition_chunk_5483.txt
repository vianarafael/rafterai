We are going to now install the Cobbler loaders and debmirror binary.

$ sudo cobbler get-loaders

For debmirror, you need to download the file from Debian, untar it, and copy it to a common location 
(alternative, you could use FPM, like we showed you in Chapter 9, to create a package to do this for you in a 
repeatable way!).

We need at least these Perl modules installed:

$ sudo yum install -y perl-LockFile-Simple perl-IO-Zlib perl-Digest-MD5 perl-Net-INET6Glue 
perl-LWP-Protocol-https

Next we will download and install the debmirror package, untar it, and place it in the /usr/local/bin 

directory.

$ curl -s http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/d/debmirror/debmirror_2.25ubuntu2.
tar.xz -o debmirror_2.25.tar.xz
$ tar xf debmirror_2.25.tar.xz && sudo cp debmirror-2.25ubuntu2/debmirror /usr/local/bin/

To test we have everything installed correctly for debmirror, run debmirror --help and make sure you 

donâ€™t get any Perl module errors.

Lastly, we are going to change the default root password that gets placed on the hosts.
