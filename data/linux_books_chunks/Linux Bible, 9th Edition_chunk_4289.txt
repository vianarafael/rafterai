Asymmetric 
 cryptography is much more complicated and often is a point of confusion in cryptography.

Asymmetric key cryptography
Asymmetric cryptography, also called private/public key cryptography, uses two keys, called 
a key pair. A key pair consists of a public key and a private key. The public key is just 
thatâ€”public. There is no need to keep it secret.
