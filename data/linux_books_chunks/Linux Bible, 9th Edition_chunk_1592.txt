For example, if /home and
/var were assigned to separate partitions, then a gluttonous user who ﬁ lls up the
/home partition wouldn’t prevent logging daemons from continuing to write to log 
ﬁ les in the /var/log directory.

Multiple partitions also make doing certain kinds of backups (such as an image 
backup) easier.
