An IPv6 address is also enabled.

In Fedora and RHEL 7, instead of assigning network interface names such as eth0 and 
wlan0, interfaces are named by their locations on the computer’s bus. For example, the 
ﬁ rst port on the network card seated in the third PCI bus for a Fedora system is named 
p3p1. The ﬁ rst embedded Ethernet port would be em1.
