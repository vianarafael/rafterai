On the SELinux Administration window that 
appears, select Booleans from the left column and look for Booleans listed with the 
samba module.

Another way to list Booleans for Samba is to use the semanage command, as follows:

# semanage boolean -l | egrep "smb|samba"

The following is a list of SELinux Booleans that apply to Samba and their descriptions.
