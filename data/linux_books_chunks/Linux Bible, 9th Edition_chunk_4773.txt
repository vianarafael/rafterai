Network packets can be identiﬁ ed many ways by the netfilter/iptables 
 ﬁ rewall. These are a few of the ways:

 ■ Source IP address

 ■ Destination IP address

 ■ Network protocol

 ■ Inbound port

 ■ Outbound port

 ■ Network state

If no rule exists for a particular packet, then the overall policy is used. Each packet 
 category or chain has a default policy.
