The following code shows the well-documented /etc/security/
time.conf PAM conﬁ guration ﬁ le.

$ cat /etc/security/time.conf
# this is an example configuration file for the pam_time module
...
# the syntax of the lines is as follows:
#
#       services;ttys;users;times
...

I recommend you read through the contents of the time.conf ﬁ le.
