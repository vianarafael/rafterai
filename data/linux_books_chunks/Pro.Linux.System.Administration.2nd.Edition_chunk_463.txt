By default, most 
distributions set a default path, usually containing the typical locations that contain executable binaries. 
Most of the time you won’t need to set your path; the default path will be suitable. If you want to change 
the path, you’ll need to update an environmental variable called $PATH. You can see what it is currently 
set to by typing $ echo $PATH.
