For example, you can list multiple facilities separated by commas in a selector (see 
Listing 18-8).

Listing 18-8.  Multiple Facilities

auth,auth-priv.crit              /var/log/auth

This sends all auth messages and all auth-priv messages with a priority of crit or higher to the file /

var/log/auth.

You cannot do this with priorities, though.
