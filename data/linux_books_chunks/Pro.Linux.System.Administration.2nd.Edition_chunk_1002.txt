The UEFI can read the GPT partition table and 
can find and execute the boot loader code in the /EFI/ directory in the EFI system partition. Unlike BIOS, 
UEFI has its own partition that the boot loader and modules can be installed into.

In FigureÂ 6-2 we can see that after our installation we have three partitions created on drive /dev/sda.
