Since we have no need 

for this user at the moment, we’ll show you how to delete the user by removing mydb from the system.

MariaDB [(none)]> DROP USER `mydb`@`localhost`;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

And since we also have no need for the mydb database, we’ll remove that, too.

MariaDB [(none)]> DROP DATABASE `mydb`;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

Teaching SQL and MariaDB administration skills is beyond the scope of this book, but these basic skills 

will allow you to set up most MariaDB-based web applications by following their installation instructions.
