With smtpd_tls_mandatory_
protocols, we are declaring that we will only support TLSv1 and above as, again, anything lower is 
considered vulnerable.

$ sudo service postfix restart

Once the Postfix service has restarted, you can test to see whether TLS is enabled using the same nc 

command we introduced earlier, as you can see in Listing 12-8.
