Each line consists of sets of numbers in six groups, which provide information on processes, 
memory, swap, input/output, system, and CPU.

Reduced performance due to excessive swap space usage will show up in two of these groups: swap 

and cpu.

The si and so columns in the swap group display the amount of swap memory that is being read from 
(si—swap in) and written to (so—swap out) your swap space.
