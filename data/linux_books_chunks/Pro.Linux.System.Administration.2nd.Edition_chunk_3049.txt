as a result, most keys used for web sites 
are 2,048 bits long and are expected to remain secure until around 2030. You can increase the key length to 
4,096 if you want.

We pass the -algorithm option to tell the openssl command to use the RSA cipher, and the -out option 

tells the openssl command where to write the key, here to the www.example.com.key file.
