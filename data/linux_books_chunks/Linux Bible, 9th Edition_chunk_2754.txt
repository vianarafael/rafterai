Therefore, typing init 3 at the command line really issues the command 
 systemctl isolate multi-user.target. Also, you can still use the runlevel 
 command to determine the current legacy runlevel, but it is strongly discouraged.

The classic SysVinit /etc/inittab handled spawning the getty or mingetty processes. 
The systemd init handles this via the getty.target unit.
