short introduction to the physical layer

The  physical  layer,  or  layer  1,  is  all  about  voltage,  electrical  signals  and  mechanical
connections. Some networks might still use coax cables, but most will have migrated to utp
(cat 5 or better) with rj45 connectors.

Devices  like  repeaters  and  hubs  are  part  of  this  layer.
