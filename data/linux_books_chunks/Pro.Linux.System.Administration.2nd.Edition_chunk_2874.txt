This, like a2enmod, will create the symlinks 

from /etc/apache2/sites-available to /etc/apache2/sites-enabled.

$ sudo a2ensite www.example.com
Enabling site www.example.com.
To activate the new configuration, you need to run:
  service apache2 reload

You can now do as the script suggests or use sudo apache2ctl graceful to manually reload the server 

configuration.
