A sandbox is an 
environment where programs can run, but their access to other objects is tightly controlled.

A process running in such an environment is said to be “sandboxed.” Thus, a targeted 
 daemon is restricted so that no malicious attacks launched through it can affect other ser-
vices or the Linux system as a whole.
