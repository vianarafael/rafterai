With the public zone selected, 
just click the services you want to open. The port allowing access to that service is opened 
immediately (when you select the Runtime conﬁ guration) and opened permanently (when 
you select the Permanent conﬁ guration).

One nice feature of the Firewall Conﬁ guration window is that, when you select to allow 
access to a service, you do more than just open a port.
