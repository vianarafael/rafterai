If we wanted to log our SSH connections we would issue the following:

$ sudo ufw allow log 22/tcp

This will log connections for SSH. For further information on these options see the ufw man page. 

Further Exploring firewall-cmd
As we have said, we can also use firewall-cmd on our CentOS hosts to manage our iptables.
