 hard links can hence only be created on the physical partition or hard drive; you can’t link to a file 

 ■ Note 
located on another drive or partition.

Soft, or symbolic, links are more like Windows shortcuts: if they are deleted, the original file remains 

and only the link is removed.

You create links with the ln command.
