example: extend a logical volume

A logical volume can be extended without unmounting the file system. Whether or not a
volume can be extended depends on the file system it uses. Volumes that are mounted as
vfat or ext2 cannot be extended, so in the example here we use the ext3 file system.

The fdisk command shows us newly added scsi-disks that will serve our lvm volume.
