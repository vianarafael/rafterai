For 
example, to set the default home directory location to /home/everyone and the default 
shell to /bin/tcsh, type the following:

# useradd -D -b /home/everyone -s /bin/tcsh

In addition to setting up user defaults, an administrator can create default ﬁ les that are 
copied to each user’s home directory for use.
