For 
example, to set the rule to allow the /whatever directory and its subdirectories to be 
shared read/write via NFS, and then apply that rule, type the following:

# semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_rw_t "/whatever(/.*)?"
# restorecon -F -R -v /whatever

If you wanted to allow users to just be able to read ﬁ les from a directory, but not write to 
it, you could assign the public_content_t ﬁ le context to the directory instead.

Using NFS Filesystems
After a server exports a directory over the network using NFS, a client computer connects 
that directory to its own ﬁ lesystem using the mount command.
