In the following 
example, a command is being tested to see if it includes at least three command-line arguments.

# [ test ] && {action}
# Perform simple single action if test is true
[ $# -ge 3 ] && echo "There are at least 3 command line arguments."

You can combine the && and || operators to make a quick, one-line if-then-else 
 statement.
