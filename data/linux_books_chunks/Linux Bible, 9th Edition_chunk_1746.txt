For packages that come with Fedora or RHEL, the key is included 
with the distribution to check all packages. However, if you try to install packages that 
are not from your distribution, you need to either import the key needed to sign those 
 packages or turn off that feature (gpgcheck=0).

To ﬁ nd other features you can set in the yum.conf ﬁ le, type man yum.conf.
