There, I could see that mount options 
user_xattr (for extended attributes such as SELinux) and acl were both implanted in the 
ﬁ lesystem super block so they would be used when the ﬁ lesystem was mounted.

If the Default mount options ﬁ eld is blank (such as when you have just created a new 
ﬁ lesystem), you can add the acl mount option using the tune2fs -o command.
