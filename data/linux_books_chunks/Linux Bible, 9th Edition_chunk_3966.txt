Look at rules in /etc/sysconfig/iptables, and see if a 

DROP or REJECT rule comes before the rules opening ports 80 and/or 443. Moving 
the rules to open those ports before any ﬁ nal DROP or REJECT lines can solve 
the problem.

 ■ Look for denied hosts. Check whether any rules drop or reject packets from 

 particular hosts or networks.
