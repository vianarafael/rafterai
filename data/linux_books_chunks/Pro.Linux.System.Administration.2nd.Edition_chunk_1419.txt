The slave 

interfaces will bring up the master automatically, but the master will not bring up the slaves.

$ sudo ifup enp0s8 && sudo ifup enp0s9

Here we are saying bring up the enp0s8 interface and, if the exit code is 0 (‘&&’), then bring up the 
enp0s9 interface. We could have also rebooted our host.
