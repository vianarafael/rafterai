We will need to change the listen-on(-v6) to listen on a 
reachable IP address.

listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; 192.168.1.1; };
listen-on-v6 port 53 { ::1; };

The next settings in Listing 10-5 are recursion (should be ‘yes’) as we are not using this dns server as 

an authoritative name server (meaning it won’t be queried for any zones itself, but rather ask other dns 
servers).
