dns records

A record

The A record, which is also called a host record contains the ipv4-address of a computer.
When a DNS client queries a DNS server for an A record, then the DNS server will resolve
the hostname in the query to an ip address. An AAAA record is similar but contains an ipv6
address instead of ipv4.

PTR record

A PTR record is the reverse of an A record.
