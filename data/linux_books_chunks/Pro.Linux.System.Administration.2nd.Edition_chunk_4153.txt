For 

example, say we have a Windows list like the following that we have saved to a file called /etc/bareos/
windows.list:

File = "C:/"
File = "D:/"

In our FileSet we would include that file list like so:

FileSet {
  Name = "Windows All Drives"
  Enable VSS = yes
  Include {
    Options {
      Signature = MD5
      Drive Type = fixed
      IgnoreCase = yes
      WildFile = "[A-Z]:/pagefile.sys"
      WildDir = "[A-Z]:/RECYCLER"
      WildDir = "[A-Z]:/$RECYCLE.BIN"
      WildDir = "[A-Z]:/System Volume Information"
      WildDir = "*/Cache/*"
      WildDir = "*/cache/*"
      Exclude = yes
      }
  @/etc/bareos/windows.list
  }
}

Here we have included the C: and D: drives on our Windows host via the @/etc/bareos/windows.list 

file.
