probably the most useful command-line option is â€“a, which combines a variety of the command-
line options to provide a detailed overview of who is logged in to your host, the login processes, and the 
host reboot and run-level details.

also useful are the last and lastb commands, which display a record of when users last logged in 
to the host and a record of bad user logins, respectively.
