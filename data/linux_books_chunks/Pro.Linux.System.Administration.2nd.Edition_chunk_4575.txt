In the LDIF format, you will 
have the index number.

In its most basic form, access is given using the following syntax:

[access|{n}]to what [ by who [ access-level ] [ control ] ]

what is an entity in the LDAP database, who is the client requesting the information, and access-level 
is the level of access you want that client to have on it.
