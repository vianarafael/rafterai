For 
example, if you wanted to share a directory, /mystuff, you would create that directory 
with the proper permissions and run the following command to make it available for read/
write access from Samba:

# semanage fcontext -a -t samba_share_t "/mystuff(/.*)?"
# restorecon -v /mystuff

After those commands are run, the /mystuff directory, along with any ﬁ les and directories 
below that point, have the ﬁ le context of samba_share_t.
