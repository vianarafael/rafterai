The name attribute is the parent of 

common name (cn), given name (gn), and surname (sn).

Let’s take a look at our own schema file that we have created, /etc/ldap/schema/exampleactive.

schema:

# $Id$

attributetype ( 1.1.3.10 NAME 'exampleActive'
DESC 'Example User Active'
SINGLE-VALUE
EQUALITY booleanMatch
SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.7)

objectclass ( 1.1.1.2 NAME 'exampleClient'
SUP top AUXILIARY
DESC 'Example.com User objectclass'
MAY ( exampleActive ))

In these two schema objects, we have two OIDs, which we made up.
