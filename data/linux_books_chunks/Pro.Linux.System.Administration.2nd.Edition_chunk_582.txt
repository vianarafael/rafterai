So how did chmod know to do that? Well, the u in our 

change represents the User class. With chmod, each class is abbreviated to a single letter:

•	

•	

•	

•	

u: User

g: Group

o: Other or everyone

a: All

After the class, you specify the action you’d like to take on the class. In the first line in Listing 4-11, the + 

sign represents adding a permission.
