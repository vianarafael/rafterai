Click the Background Image check box if you want to 
select an Image for the background, and then select an image, such as a tile from 
/usr/share/backgrounds/tiles or another directory.

I usually turn on the AutoHide feature and turn off the Hide buttons. Using AutoHide gives you more desktop space 
to work with.
