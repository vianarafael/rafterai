When you 
install the operating system, the disk is divided into one or more partitions. Each partition is 
 formatted with a Ô¨Å lesystem. In the case of Linux, some of the partitions may be specially  formatted 
for elements such as a swap area or LVM physical volumes. Disks are used for permanent storage; 
random access memory (RAM) and swap are used for temporary storage.
