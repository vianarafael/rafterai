With CentOS we access the networking settings via the Applications ➤ System Tools ➤ Settings.

In Figure 7-4 we can see the configured networks on our system. In the left-hand panel you can select 

the devices that attached to the system, here our network interface is called “Wired.” The gear cog in the 
bottom right allows you to access the configuration.
