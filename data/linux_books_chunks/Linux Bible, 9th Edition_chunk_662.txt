In those cases, you can 
check the possible ways text can be expanded by pressing Tab twice at the point where you 
want to do completion.

The following shows the result you would get if you checked for possible completions

$ echo $P<Tab><Tab>
$PATH $PPID $PS1 $PS2 $PS4 $PWD
$ echo $P

In this case, there are six possible variables that begin with $P.
