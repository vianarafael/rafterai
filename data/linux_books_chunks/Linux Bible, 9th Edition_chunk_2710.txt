However, remember that the runlevels 2–5 on 
Ubuntu are equivalent to SysVinit runlevel 5. Therefore, this activity is rather pointless.

System initialization compatibility to SysVinit is maintained on some distributions, 
such as Ubuntu, via the /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf conﬁ guration ﬁ le. This is one 
of the conﬁ guration ﬁ les used at system boot.
