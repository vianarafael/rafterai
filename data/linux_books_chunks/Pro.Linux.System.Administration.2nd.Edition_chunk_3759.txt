If it is not running, you can start it by 

issuing the following (swapping nfs for nfs-server on Ubuntu):

$ sudo systemctl restart nfs
$ sudo systemctl enable nfs

Once done, you need to edit the /etc/exports file.
NFS reads its share instruction from the /etc/exports file. Here you add the directories you want to 

share along with some options as to how you want them shared.
