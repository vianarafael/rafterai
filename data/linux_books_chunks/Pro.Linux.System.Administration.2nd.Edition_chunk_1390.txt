With nmcli we issue the following:

$ sudo nmcli device status
DEVICE  TYPE      STATE         CONNECTION
enp0s8  ethernet  disconnected  --
enp0s9  ethernet  disconnected  --

This shows our devices are currently in the disconnected state. We are now going to bring up our master 

(bond0) interface by starting our slave interfaces.
