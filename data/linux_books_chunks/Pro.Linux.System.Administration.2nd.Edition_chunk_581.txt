On directories x means traverse, meaning that you 
can list directories in the parent directory but you canâ€™t go any further.

After our update, the permissions on our file would now look as follows:

-rwxr--r--   1 root  root      0  2016-07-15 20:47 myfile

You can see the addition of the x to the User class.
