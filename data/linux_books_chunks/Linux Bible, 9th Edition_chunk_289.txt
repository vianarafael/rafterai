By using 
Fedora, you will learn the skills you need to work with features as they are being 
developed for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

 ■ For learning, Fedora is more convenient than RHEL, yet still includes many of the 

more advanced, enterprise-ready tools that are in RHEL.

 ■ Fedora is free, not only as in “freedom” but also as in “you don’t have to 

pay for it.”

Fedora is extremely popular with those who develop open source software.
