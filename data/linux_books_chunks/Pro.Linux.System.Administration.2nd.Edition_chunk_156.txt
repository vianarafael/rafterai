The DnS servers you set will also need to be Ipv6 addresses.

IPV4 AND IPV6

The Internet works by computers being able to send each other messages. To be able to do this there 
needs to be a set of unique addresses all along the path between each other. Ipv4 was the first release 
of this protocol that made this possible.

The unique addresses in Ipv4 are based on a 32-bit address space.
