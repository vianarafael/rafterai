Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given 
local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that 
most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the 
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in 
return for a fee.

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the 
public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can 
redistribute and change under these terms.
