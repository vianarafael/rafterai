Using the umount command
When you are ﬁ nished using a temporary ﬁ lesystem, or you want to unmount a permanent 
ﬁ lesystem temporarily, use the umount command. This command detaches the ﬁ lesystem 
from its mount point in your Linux ﬁ lesystem. To use umount, you can give it either a 
directory name or a device name.
