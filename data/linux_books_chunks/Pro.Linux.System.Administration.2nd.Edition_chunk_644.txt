You can use grep to do 

complex regular expression searches in files, for example:

$ grep 'J[oO][bB]' *

This would find the strings JOB, Job, JOb, or JoB in all files in the current directory (remember, grep is 
case sensitive by default, so our regular expression has explicitly specified upper- and lowercase variations).
