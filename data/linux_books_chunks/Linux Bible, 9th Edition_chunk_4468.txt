If you are not using the wheel group, just be sure not to 
assign anyone in the future to this group.

Next, you need to edit the /etc/pam.d/su conﬁ guration ﬁ le. Remove the comment mark, 
#, from the following line:

#auth        required    pam_wheel.so use_uid

With these modiﬁ cations, PAM disables the use of the su command.
