It does this by sending either network pings to nodes or 
unicast packets that participating hosts can react to.

Since we are not setting up a cluster, we can just start the service now without changing the 

configuration.

$ sudo systemctl start elasticsearch

Chapter 18 â–  Logging and Monitoring

Of course, we can always use the status subcommand of systemctl to check the status of our 

Elasticsearch service, but we can also issue the following command from the command line:

$ curl http://localhost:9200
{
  "name" : "7mf_JBi",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "69nMGfoYRYiwatKO6Nj1BA",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "5.0.2",
    "build_hash" : "f6b4951",
    "build_date" : "2016-11-24T10:07:18.101Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "6.2.1"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}

This curl command to port 9200 shows that our Elasticsearch server is responding.
