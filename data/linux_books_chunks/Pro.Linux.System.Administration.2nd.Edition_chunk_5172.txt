Logstash and Beats help us 
move the log information off our hosts and process them ready for storage so that we can use discovery tools 
to see analysis of what is happening on our systems. The storage and discovery are handled by Elasticsearch 
and Kibana, and we will look those in the next section.

Beats are lightweight forwarders of logs, metrics, network packets data, and Windows events.
