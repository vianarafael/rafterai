In Listing 5-11, we have set the maximum password age to 60 days using the PASS_MAX_DAYS option, 
allowing users to change their passwords at any time by setting the PASS_MIN_DAYS option to 0 and providing 
a warning to users that their passwords will expire seven days before the password expiration date using the 
PASS_WARN_AGE option.

lock, option.
