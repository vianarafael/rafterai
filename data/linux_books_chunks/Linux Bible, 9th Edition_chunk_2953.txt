(Of course, both CUPS and UNIX print servers can be run from Linux 
 systems as well as other UNIX systems.)

In each case, you need a network connection from your Linux system to the servers to 
which those printers are connected. To use a remote printer requires that someone set up 
that printer on the remote server computer.
