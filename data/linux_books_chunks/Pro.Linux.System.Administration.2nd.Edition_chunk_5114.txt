This assumes the rsyslog daemon on the remote 

host has been configured to receive logs and that you have suitable firewall rules in place to receive the log 
entries. Here’s an example:

$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone public --add-port=514/udp

Here we’ve created a firewall rule that allows the host to receive rsyslog data from the host 
192.168.0.254 on UDP port 514.
