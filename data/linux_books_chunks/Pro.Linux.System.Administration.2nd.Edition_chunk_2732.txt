the latest and most feature-rich 
version of this software is provided by the xinetd package.

each service that is managed by xinetd has its own configuration file snippet in the /etc/xinetd.d 
directory, and by default it will install configuration files for some very basic services, such as echo, 
which simply repeats any character you send to it.
