Allowing ICMP(ping)

When you enable iptables, you will get an 'Operation not permitted' message when trying
to ping other hosts.

[root@RHEL5 ~# ping 192.168.187.130
PING 192.168.187.130 (192.168.187.130) 56(84) bytes of data.
ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted
ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted

The  screenshot  below  shows  you  how  to  setup  iptables  to  allow  a  ping  from  or  to  your
machine.

[root@RHEL5 ~]# iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type any -j ACCEPT
[root@RHEL5 ~]# iptables -A OUTPUT -p icmp --icmp-type any -j ACCEPT

The previous two lines do not allow other computers to route ping messages through your
router, because it only handles INPUT and OUTPUT.
