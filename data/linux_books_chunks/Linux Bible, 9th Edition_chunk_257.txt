Most of 
the following rules for acceptable open source licenses serve to protect the freedom and 
integrity of the open source code:

 ■ Free distribution—An open source license can’t require a fee from anyone who 

resells the software.

 ■ Source code—The source code must be included with the software and there can be 

no restrictions on redistribution.

 ■ Derived works—The license must allow modiﬁ cation and redistribution of the code 

under the same terms.

 ■ Integrity of the author’s source code—The license may require that those who 
use the source code remove the original project’s name or version if they change 
the source code.

 ■ No discrimination against persons or groups—The license must allow all people 

to be equally eligible to use the source code.

 ■ No discrimination against fields of endeavor—The license can’t restrict a project 
from using the source code because it is commercial or because it is associated with 
a ﬁ eld of endeavor that the software provider doesn’t like.

 ■ Distribution of license—No additional license should be needed to use and 

 redistribute the software.

 ■ License must not be specific to a product—The license can’t restrict the source 

code to a particular software distribution.

 ■ License must not restrict other software—The license can’t prevent someone 
from including the open source software on the same medium as non–open 
source software.

 ■ License must be technology-neutral—The license can’t restrict methods in which 

the source code can be redistributed.

Open source licenses used by software development projects must meet these criteria to be 
accepted as open source software by OSI.
