The  following 
code demonstrates this process:

$ gpg2 --output JohnDoe.DS --sign MessageForJill.txt

You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "John Doe (The User) <jdoe@example.com>"
2048-bit RSA key, ID 3B2E46D5, created 2016-12-08

After the user jill receives the signed and encrypted ﬁ le, she can use the gpg2 utility 
to check the digital signature and decrypt the ﬁ le in one step.
