There arenâ€™t  separate 
scripts for stopping and starting a service. These scripts will stop or start a service 
 depending upon what parameter is passed to them by the init daemon.

Each script in /etc/rc.d/init.d takes care of all that is needed for starting or stopping 
a particular service on the server.
