The DNS information for these TLDs is stored in so-called root servers.

There are presently 13 globally distributed root name servers in the world that return the list of 
authoritive name servers for the TLDs. There are not actually just 13 servers chugging away at this but a 
highly distributed cluster of dedicated servers in multiple datacenters.
