In the /etc/bareos/bconsole.conf file, we define the following:

Director {
  Name = example-dir
  DIRport = 9101
  Address = backup.example.com
  Password = "uogx2tNL9dRUwGfNvY/b+uQrU8osZn+JOM7t8iIrpszN"
}

This has the same details (Name, port, Address, and Password) as the Directory resource in the bareos-

dir.conf configuration file.
