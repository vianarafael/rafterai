With the -c option, if the download fails, you can then just 
rerun the command and the download will resume from the point at which it stopped.

The wget command downloads files to the current directory, so we now have a tarball we can 

unpack. The extension tells us it was compressed using gzip, so we need the -z flag to make tar use gzip 
decompression.
