bootloader

The mbr is executed by the bios and contains either (a small) bootloader or code to load
a bootloader.

Looking at the mbr with od can reveal information about the bootloader.

paul@laika:~$ sudo dd if=/dev/sda count=1 bs=16 skip=24 2>/dev/null|od -c

There are a variety of bootloaders available, most common on Intel architecture is grub,
which is replacing lilo in many places.
