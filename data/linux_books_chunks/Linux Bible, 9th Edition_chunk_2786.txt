The options are very similar to SysVinit’s service command:

 ■ Stopping a service with Upstart—In the following example, the status of the 
cups daemon is checked and then stopped using the initctl stop cups 
command.

# initctl status cups
cups start/running, process 2390
# initctl stop cups
cups stop/waiting
# initctl status cups
cups stop/waiting

 ■ Starting a service with Upstart—In the following example, the cups daemon is 

started using the initctl start cups command.

# initctl start cups
cups start/running, process 2408
# initctl status cups
cups start/running, process 2408

 ■ Restarting a service with Upstart—Restarting a service with Upstart stops and 

then starts the service.
