When you are Ô¨Å nished with the Linux live image, you can reboot the computer, 
pop out the CD or DVD, and go back to running whatever operating system was installed on 
the hard disk.

To try out a GNOME desktop along with the descriptions in this section, I suggest you get a 
Fedora Live DVD (as described in Appendix A).
