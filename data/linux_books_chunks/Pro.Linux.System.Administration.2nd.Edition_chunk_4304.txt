By default, 
our OpenVPN server will take the address 10.8.0.1 and assign the remaining addresses to incoming VPN 
connections.

Weâ€™ve specified an option called keepalive that is used to keep our connection open. We specify the 
keepalive option and two values, 10 and 120. The value 10 indicates that OpenVPN will ping the connection 
every 10 seconds to check it is active.
