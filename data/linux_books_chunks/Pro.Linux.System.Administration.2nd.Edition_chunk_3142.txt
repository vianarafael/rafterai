The final two numbers control how many subdirectories Squid will create in 
the main cache directory. In this case, it will create 16 main subdirectories, each containing another 256 
subdirectories.

This subdirectory schema came about because most filesystems are quite slow at accessing directories 

containing a large number of files.
