As usual, there are often several ways to 
accomplish some of the tasks here. So don’t worry if you don’t go about the exercises in 
exactly the same way as shown in the answers, as long as you get the same results. See 
Appendix B for suggested solutions.

Don’t do these exercises on a Linux system running a Samba server because they will 
almost certainly interfere with that server.
