These can be distributed via the OpenVPN Access Server or by other means. In this example, we will create 
an .ovpn profile file for our mobile client, upload that to our OpenVPN app in iTunes, and connect to our 
OpenVPN server.

A profile is basically the same as a normal OpenVPN configuration file. The difference is we include the TLS 

certificates, including the private key.
