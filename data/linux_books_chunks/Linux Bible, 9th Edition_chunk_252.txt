The Linux Foundationâ€™s primary charter is to protect and accelerate the 
growth of Linux by  providing legal protection and software development standards for 
Linux developers.

Although much of the thrust of corporate Linux efforts is on corporate, enterprise 
 computing, huge improvements are continuing in the desktop arena as well.
