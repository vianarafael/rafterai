Although it happens much less often than it did with earlier releases of Fedora and 
RHEL, it is possible for the RPM database to become corrupted. This stops you from install-
ing, removing, or listing RPM packages.

If you Ô¨Å nd that your rpm and yum commands are hanging or failing and returning an 
rpmdb open fails message, you can try rebuilding the RPM database.
