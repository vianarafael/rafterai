With GNOME 3, a Linux desktop now appears more 
like the graphical interfaces on mobile devices, with less focus on multiple mouse buttons 
and key combinations and more on mouse movement and one-click operations.

Instead of feeling structured and rigid, the GNOME 3 desktop seems to expand as you 
need it to. As a new application is run, its icon is added to the Dash.
