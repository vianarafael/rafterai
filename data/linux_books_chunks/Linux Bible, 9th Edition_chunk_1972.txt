The following is 
an example of what a line would look like that mounts the ext4 ﬁ lesystem located on the
/dev/sdc1 device to the /var/stuff directory:

/dev/sdc1     /var/stuff      ext4    acl        1 2

Instead of the defaults entry in the fourth ﬁ eld, I added acl. If there were already 
options set in that ﬁ eld, add a comma after the last option and add acl.
