After the boot loader starts the kernel, how the rest of the 
 activities (mounting Ô¨Å lesystems, setting kernel options, running services, and so on) are 
done is all managed by the initialization process.

As I describe the boot process, I focus on two different types of initialization: System V 
init and systemd.
