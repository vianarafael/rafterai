You can also manually run it 
on the command line.

If running on the command line, logrotate defaults to a configuration file of /etc/logrotate.conf. 

You can override this configuration file, as you can see on the following line:

$ sudo logrotate /etc/logrotate2.conf

The logrotate command also has several command-line options to use, as shown in TableÂ 18-3.
