To add an MX record, 

we will add one after the NS record in our example.com.db file, like the following:

       IN    NS         ns.example.com.
       IN    MX  10  mail.example.com.

We have the name of the record, the Internet type (IN), the record type (MX), the mail server priority (10), 

and the host it maps to (mail.example.com).
