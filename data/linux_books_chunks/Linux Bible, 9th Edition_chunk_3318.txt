This example tells SELinux to allow uploading of Ô¨Å les to the /var/ftp/
pub/uploads directory:

# semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_rw_t "/var/ftp/pub/uploads(/.*)?"
# restorecon -F -R -v /var/ftp/pub/uploads

FTP server features that are considered insecure by SELinux have Booleans that let you 
allow or disallow those features.
