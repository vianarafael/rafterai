A firewall is a device that besides acting
as a router, also contains (and implements) rules to determine whether packets are allowed
to travel from one network to another. A firewall can be configured to block access based
on networks, hosts, protocols and ports. Firewalls can also change the contents of packets
while forwarding them.
