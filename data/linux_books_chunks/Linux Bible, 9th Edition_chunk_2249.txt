Using the vim command can help you catch 
 confi guration fi le errors as you are editing.

The vim command knows about the formats of many confi guration fi les (passwd, httpd.conf, fstab, and 
others). If you make a mistake and type an invalid term or option in one of those fi les, or break the format somehow, 
the color of the text changes.
