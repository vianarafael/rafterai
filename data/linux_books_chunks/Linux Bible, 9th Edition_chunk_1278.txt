You may need to log in over the network to make a change to a Linux 
system but ﬁ nd that the system doesn’t allow root users in from over the net-
work (a common practice for  secure Linux systems). One solution is to use the su 
 command. From any Terminal window or shell, you can simply type the following:

$ su
Password: ******
#

When you are prompted, type the root user’s password.
