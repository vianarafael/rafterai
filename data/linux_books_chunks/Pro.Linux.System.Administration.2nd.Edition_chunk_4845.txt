a parent will send a wait system call 
to the child process to read its exit status. if this does not happen, the process cannot be removed from 
the process list and remains there. it is not necessarily a problem as it should be eventually reaped by 
the parent or by systemd (init). in this state, it has already deallocated its memory and is not using 
CpU.
