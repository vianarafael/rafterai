This is how the hosts entry in the /etc/resolv.conf Ô¨Å le

hosts:      files dns

You can add other locations, such as Network Information Service (nis or nisplus) 
 databases, for querying hostname to IP address resolution. You can also change the order in 
which the different services are queried.
