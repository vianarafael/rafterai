Our script will be called printtotty10 and will 
simply print the message given as an argument to /dev/tty10.

/bin/printtotty10

#!/bin/bash

echo $1 > /dev/tty10

1. One way to have the script started at a specific run level is to add a line in /etc/inittab 
like

pr10:3:once:/bin/printtotty10 “Printtotty was started in inittab”

This is not always the best way to do this.
