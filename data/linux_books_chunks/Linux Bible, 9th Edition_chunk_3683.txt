For example, if 
you mount /usr/trip and /usr/trip/extra as NFS fi lesystems and /usr/trip is not yet mounted when 
/usr/trip/extra tries to mount, /usr/trip/extra times out. If you’re lucky, /usr/trip comes up and 
/usr/trip/extra mounts on the next retry.

 ■ fg—If the ﬁ rst mount attempt times out, try subsequent mounts in the fore-

ground. This is the default behavior.
