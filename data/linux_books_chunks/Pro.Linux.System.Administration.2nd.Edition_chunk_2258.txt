When a filesystem fills up, services that use it may refuse to start, stop working, or crash.
You can list space usage for an entire filesystem via the df command, which is usually used with the 

-h option. This option produces human-readable output with numbers in KiB, MiB, GiB, or TiB instead of 
blocks, as shown in Listing 9-11.
