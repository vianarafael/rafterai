A wan does not use ethernet, but
protocols like fddi, frame relay, ATM or X.25 to connect computers (and networks).

The  picture  below  shows  a  branch  office  that  is  connected  through  Frame  Relay  with
headquarters.

The acronym wan is also used for large surface area networks like the internet.

Cisco  is  known  for  their  wan  technology.
