The following is an example of the syntax of the setfacl command:

setfacl -m u:username:rwx filename

In the example just shown, the modify option (-m) is followed by the letter u,  indicating 
that you are setting ACL permissions for a user. After a colon (:), you indicate the 
 username, followed by another colon and the permissions you want to assign.
