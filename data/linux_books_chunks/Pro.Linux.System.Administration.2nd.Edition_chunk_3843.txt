Add to this version control of your documents, and you 
have greater security of the data you are sharing with your colleagues.

Of course, we have online document management like Google Docs, Quip, and Microsoft360, and 

these may be just fine for your needs. In many cases, using these solutions are great for small businesses 
that donâ€™t have the infrastructure and are relatively low cost.
