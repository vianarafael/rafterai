SCSI tape devices are located underneath /dev/st and are
numbered starting with 0 for the first tape device.

/dev/st0   First tape device
/dev/st1   Second tape device
/dev/st2   Third tape device

To prevent automatic rewinding of tapes, prefix them with the letter n.

/dev/nst0   First no rewind tape device
/dev/nst1   Second no rewind tape device
/dev/nst2   Third no rewind tape device

By default, SCSI tapes on Linux will use the highest hardware compression that is supported
by the tape device.
