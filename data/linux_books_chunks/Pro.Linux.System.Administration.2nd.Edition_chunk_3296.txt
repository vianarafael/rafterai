The Certbot process requires a web server to manage the validation process to get 
your certificate. The good news is that the certbot command has the option to run a stand-alone web server 
while we run the process to get the certificates.

The certbot stand-alone web service will need port 80 (HTTP) or port 443 (HTTPS) access to your host. 

We can do this with the ufw or firewall-cmd command.
