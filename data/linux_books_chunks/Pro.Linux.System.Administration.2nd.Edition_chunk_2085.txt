You might remember that the MBR, stored in the first 446 bytes of the disk, 
describes the partition information, which is stored in the 64 bytes directly after the boot record. You canâ€™t 
store a lot of data in 64 bytes, so the number of partitions a disk could hold was originally rather limited.
