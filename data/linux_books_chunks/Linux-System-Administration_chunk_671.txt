process id 1

The kernel receives system control from the bootloader. After a while the kernel starts the
init daemon. The init daemon (/sbin/init) is the first daemon that is started and receives
process id 1 (PID 1). Init never dies.

When /sbin/init is started, it will first read its configuration file /etc/inittab.
