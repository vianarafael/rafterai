Note that on some distributions, you may see a few 
services in both the initctl and the service command output.

# service --status-all | grep running
abrtd (pid  1118) is running...
acpid (pid  996) is running...
atd (pid  1146) is running...
...
rsyslogd (pid  752) is running...
sendmail (pid  1099) is running...
...

Just because a service is not in a running state does not mean it is unavailable.
