To select everything recursively in a directory, you can use the 
mark * command. When you are finished selecting the files you want to restore, use the done command.

You are given a list of the media volumes required to perform this restore. You will have to load them if 

they are not already available to your backup host. Then you are given the rundown of the restore job you are 
going to run.
