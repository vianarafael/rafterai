If you want to remove a directory, you need to use the recursive (-r) option to rm or, 
for an empty directory, you can use the rmdir command. Consider the following examples:

$ rmdir /home/joe/nothing/
$ rm -r /home/joe/bigdir/
$ rm -rf /home/joe/hugedir/

The rmdir command in the preceding code only removes the directory (nothing) if it is 
empty.
