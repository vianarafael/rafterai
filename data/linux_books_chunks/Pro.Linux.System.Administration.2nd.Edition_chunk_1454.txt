There 
are instances in which part of the Internet will go down because a core router is broken. In this situation, all 
your private network pings will return, but some pings to hosts on the Internet may not. If you donâ€™t get a 
response from one host on the Internet, try another to see if the issue is local or somewhere else down the 
line.
