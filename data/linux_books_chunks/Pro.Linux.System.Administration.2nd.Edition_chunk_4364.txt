Unless we secure a particular application or 
protocol (e.g., in the way we used SSL/TLS in Chapter 12 to protect our SMTP and IMAP services), then 
an attacker could read our data from that network. Because of this potential security issue, across this 
connection weâ€™ve instantiated our second path between these hosts, the 10.8.0.0/24 network that we are 
using for our VPN tunnels.
