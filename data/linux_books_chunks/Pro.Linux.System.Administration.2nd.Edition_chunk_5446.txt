The Service Detail screen

Here in FigureÂ 18-13 we can see the status of the services that we are checking on our hosts. You can see 

the check for Current Load is working on our gateway server. The HTTP check is in a WARNING state because 
the httpd service is responding but the result is not 200 OK but rather 403.
