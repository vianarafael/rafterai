The OSI model is made 
up of seven layers. Each of those layers has a special responsibility in the process of communicating data 
between hosts over the wire. In diagnosing your network, you will normally be interested in the layers 1, 2, 
and 3. You can see a description of these layers in Figure 7-12.
