Although the nfsd server daemon itself is not enabled 
for TCP wrappers, the rpcbind service is.

For NFSv3 and earlier versions, simply adding a line such as the following to the 
/etc/hosts.deny Ô¨Å le would deny access to the rpcbind service, but would also deny 
access to your NFS service:

rpcbind: ALL

For servers running NFSv4 by default, however, the rpcbind: ALL line just shown 
 prevents outside hosts from getting information about RPC services (such as NFS) using 
commands like showmount.
