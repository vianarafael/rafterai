Remember that SysVinit 
keeps symbolic links here for starting and stopping various services at certain runlevels. 
Each directory represents a particular runlevel; for example, rc5.d is for runlevel 5. Notice 
that only Ô¨Å les starting with a K are listed, so there are links for killing off the cups dae-
mon.
