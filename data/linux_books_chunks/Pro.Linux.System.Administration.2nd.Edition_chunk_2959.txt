If the file is too large, then the recovery time can be lengthened. 

In FigureÂ 11-5, we can see the log file size of MariaDB 5.5, which has the default of 5MB. Versions of 
MariaDB 10.0 and above have a default of 48MB. For older MariaDB 5.5 versions, before we change the 
InnoDB transaction log file size, we need to ensure the transaction log files no longer contain any live data.
