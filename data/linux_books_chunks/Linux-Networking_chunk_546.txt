iterative or recursive query

A recursive query is a DNS query where the client that is submitting the query expects a
complete answer (Like the fat red arrow above going from the Macbook to the DNS server).
An iterative query is a DNS query where the client does not expect a complete answer (the
three black arrows originating from the DNS server in the picture above).
