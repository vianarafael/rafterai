You can manually edit the configuration on 
the client, but that means you need to log in to a client to make changes to the network configuration. You 
might also end up with IP address clashes if DHCP assigns the same address to a new host that someone has 
assigned to another.

DHCP allows you to assign the same IP address to a host by matching it with the hostâ€™s MAC address.
