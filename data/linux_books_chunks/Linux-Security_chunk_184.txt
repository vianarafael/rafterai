encryption with crypt

A third option is to create your own C program using the crypt function, and compile this
into a command.

paul@rhel65:~$ cat MyCrypt.c
#include <stdio.h>
#define __USE_XOPEN
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
 if(argc==3)
   {
       printf("%s\n", crypt(argv[1],argv[2]));
   }
   else
   {
       printf("Usage: MyCrypt $password $salt\n" );
   }
  return 0;
}

This little program can be compiled with gcc like this.

paul@rhel65:~$ gcc MyCrypt.c -o MyCrypt -lcrypt

To use it, we need to give two parameters to MyCrypt.
