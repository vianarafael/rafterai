The command to move the database to its new location and give it a 
new name is as follows:

# cp /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz /var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz

When you are ready to check whether your ﬁ les have been tampered with, you need to 
create a new database, the “second picture,” and compare it to the original database, the 
“ﬁ rst picture.” The check option on the aide command, -c, creates a new database and 
runs a comparison against the old database.
