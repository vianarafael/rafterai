We can slice this group up for our volumes and also use fancy disk magic to extend and 
shrink volumes after we have created them.

In FigureÂ 2-58 we are asked how much of the Volume Group we want to use for this partitioning, and we 

will choose the default to use all of it, or 8.1 GB.

You will now be shown the LVM partition layout, which will show a small amount for swap space and 
the rest for the root or / partition.
