The 
mount command will mount every thing in /etc/fstab that has not yet been mounted and 
that is not encrypted or networked:

mount -a -t nonfs,smbfs,ncpfs -o no_netdev,noloop,noencrypted

When shutting down, all filesystem are unmounted by the halt script by scanning the 
/proc/mounts file with the help of some awk commands!

Swap Partions and SWAP files

At boot time, swap partitions are activated in /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit 

swapon -a

Similarly when the system shuts down swap is turned off in the halt rc-script:

SWAPS=`awk '! /^Filename/ { print $1 }' /proc/swaps`

[ -n "$SWAPS" ] && runcmd "Turning off swap: " swapoff $SWAPS

Example 1: Making a swap file of 10MB
