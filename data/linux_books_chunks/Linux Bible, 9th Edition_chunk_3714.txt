When you run the following command, the joe user account 
is created, but you see an error message stating that the home directory already 
exists (which is correct):

# useradd -u 507 -c "Joe Smith" -d /home/remote/joe joe
# passwd joe
Changing password for user joe.
New password: ********
Retype new password: ********
