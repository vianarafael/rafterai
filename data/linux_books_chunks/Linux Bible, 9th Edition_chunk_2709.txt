The  example 
of the /etc/inittab ﬁ le that follows comes from a server running a version of Fedora, 
which uses the Upstart init daemon.

$ cat /etc/inittab
# inittab is only used by upstart for the default runlevel.
#
# ADDING OTHER CONFIGURATION HERE WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON YOUR SYSTEM.
#
...
#
id:5:initdefault:

As you can see from the comment lines in the /etc/inittab ﬁ le, the only thing this 
ﬁ le is used for on Linux distributions that maintain it is to change the default runlevel at 
server boot time.

To change the default runlevel on an Ubuntu distribution that uses Upstart, edit /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf 
and change the line env DEFAULT_RUNLEVEL=# where # is 2 to 5.
