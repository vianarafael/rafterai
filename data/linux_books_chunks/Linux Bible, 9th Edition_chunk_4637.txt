Thus, it is important to make 
sure your Linux system is logging messages in the Ô¨Å rst place.

A quick way to determine if the logging is taking place is to check if the proper daemons 
are running: auditd, rsyslogd, and/or setroubleshootd. Use an appropriate com-
mand, such as systemctl status auditd.service. Of course, the command you use 
depends on your Linux distribution and its version.
