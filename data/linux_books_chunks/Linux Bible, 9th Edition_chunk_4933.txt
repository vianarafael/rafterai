Choose the amount of RAM and number of proces-
sors available to the VM, and click Forward. I suggest at least 1024MB of RAM and 
at least one processor. Using 2048MB of RAM, if it is available, is better.

e.  Enable storage. Choose the amount of disk space you want the VM to consume. I 

suggest at least 10GB for a Fedora Workstation, but you could probably get by with 
less.
