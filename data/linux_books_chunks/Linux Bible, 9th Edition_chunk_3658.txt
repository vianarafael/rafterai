Here is an example of the mount command and its output 
(with ﬁ lesystems not pertinent to this discussion edited out):

# mount -t nfs
maple:/stuff on /mnt/maple type nfs (rw,relatime,vers=3,rsize=65536,
  wsize=65536,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,
  mountaddr=192.168.0.122,mountvers=3,mountport=892,mountproto=udp,
  local_lock=none,addr=192.168.0.122)

The output from the mount -t nfs command shows only those ﬁ lesystems mounted 
from NFS ﬁ le servers.
