Completed installation ready for Reboot

Your system will begin to restart and present to you the GRUB2 (GRand Unified Bootloader) boot 
loader. The boot loader is the small bit of code that actually loads your operating system. This allows you to 
choose the operating system to boot into or boot into other operating systems you might have installed.
