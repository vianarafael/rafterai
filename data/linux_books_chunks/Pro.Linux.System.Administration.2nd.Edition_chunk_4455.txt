We could then use exampleActive to enable and disable entries by setting it to TRUE or FALSE.

Hereâ€™s how this would look in an LDAP entry:

dn: uid=user1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
uid: user1
exampleActive: TRUE

Once this attribute is added to an entry in LDAP, we can use filters to search for all instances of 
exampleActive = TRUE in our LDAP directory, which would speed up the results for active users.
