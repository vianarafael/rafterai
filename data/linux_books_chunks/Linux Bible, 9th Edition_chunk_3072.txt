After you start the httpd service (as shown in later 
steps), you can access this set of manuals from a web browser on the local 
machine by typing http://localhost/manual into the location box.

 ■ Externally, instead of localhost, you could use the fully qualiﬁ ed domain name 

or IP address of the system.
