These commands take advantage of polite routers that send back “TTL expired in transit” messages when 
they kill your packet.

Let’s take a look at an example. If we do a ping to www.ibm.com and set the TTL to 1, it gets to the first 

router along the path to whatever www.ibm.com resolves to. That first router looks at the TTL and sees that it 
is 1.
