To install the xeyes command, run it about 20 times in the background, and run 

killall to kill all 20 xeyes processes at once, type the following:

# yum install xorg-x11-apps
$ xeyes &
$ xeyes &
...
$ killall xeyes 

Remember, you need to be the root user to install the package. After that, remem-
ber to repeat the xeyes command 20 times.
