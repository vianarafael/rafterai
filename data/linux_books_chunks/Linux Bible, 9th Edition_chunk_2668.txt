However, you can 
see that the search for systemd yields the existence of the systemd daemon.

# strings /sbin/init | grep -i upstart
# strings /sbin/init | grep -i systemd
systemd.unit=
systemd.log_target=
systemd.log_level=
...

If you do not have the strings command on your Linux system, you can install it via the binutils package. On 
RHEL and Fedora, use the command yum install binutils.
