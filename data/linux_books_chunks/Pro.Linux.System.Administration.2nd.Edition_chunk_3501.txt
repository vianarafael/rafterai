We do that by adding the 
following to our CentOS host:

milter_default_action = accept
smtpd_milters = unix:/var/run/clamav-milter/clamav-milter.socket

Because with Ubuntu we are talking to the milter over the loopback address, we will need to have the 

following:

milter_default_action = accept
smtpd_milters = inet:7357

Lastly, on CentOS, we need to make some adjustments to our SELinux policies.
