Prior to this, though, we should validate our Apache 

configuration. We do this with the following:

$ sudo apachectl configtest
Syntax OK

Here we are using the apachectl command to manage our Apache service. The apachectl program 

can be used to start, stop, restart, gracefully restart, and check the configuration, as we have done here. See 
the man apachectl page for more information.
