In the following code, the account is set to be 
locked 5 days after timâ€™s password expires, by using only the -I option.

# chage -I 5 tim
# chage -l tim | grep Password
Password expires                 : never
Password inactive                : never

Notice that no settings changed! Without a password expiration set, the -I option has no 
effect.
