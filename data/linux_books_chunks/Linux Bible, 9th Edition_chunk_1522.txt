When prompted, you can leave the 
default subscription management system in place (subscription.rhn.redhat.com) 
or enter the location of a Red Hat Satellite server to register your system. You 
need your Red Hat account and password to register and entitle your system 
for updates. In most cases, you can automatically attach an entitlement to the 
system.
