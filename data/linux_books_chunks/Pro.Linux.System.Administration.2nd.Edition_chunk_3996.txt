If there is an error, an e-mail will be sent to jsmith@example.com. This is a great way to sync up files from 
one host to another, but it is not really a great backup strategy. For instance, every night we sync over all the 
changed files, including mistakes. If they are not noticed early enough, then the mistakes are propagated to 
our backup host and we lose our good copy of data.
