XFS was developed by Silicon Graphics, 
Inc., for its IRIX operating system.

The filesystem driver of XFS was open sourced some years ago and IRIX helped working on integrating 
it into the Linux kernel, as Linux lacked a journaling filesystem at the time. The community enthusiastically 
embraced these newly open source filesystems, as both offered new features and excellent performance.
