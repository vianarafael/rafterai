If a TCP/IP network connection exists between the computers 
sharing the printer, you simply grant permission to all hosts, individual hosts, or users 
from remote hosts to access your computer’s printing service.

To manually conﬁ gure a printer entry in the /etc/cups/printers.conf ﬁ le to accept 
print jobs from all other computers, make sure the Shared Yes line is set.
