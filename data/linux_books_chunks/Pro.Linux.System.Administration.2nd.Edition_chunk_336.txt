But let’s say you are happy with your diff and you 
are now ready to commit those changes.

$ git commit –v path/to/file/or/directory

You will be shown the diff of your changes again and you will be able to add a commit message to the commit 
so that people know what the change is. Good commit messages give some idea of what you did - preferably what 
was done and why it was done.
