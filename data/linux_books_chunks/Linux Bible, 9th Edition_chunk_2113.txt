Next, 
I use the pvdisplay command to see if that partition is being used in an LVM group:

# pvdisplay /dev/sda2
  --- Physical volume ---
  PV Name               /dev/sda2
  VG Name               vg_abc
  PV Size               148.52 GiB / not usable 2.00 MiB
  Allocatable           yes (but full)
  PE Size               4.00 MiB
  Total PE              38021
  Free PE               0
  Allocated PE          38021
  PV UUID               wlvuIv-UiI2-pNND-f39j-oH0X-9too-AOII7R

You can see that the LVM physical volume represented by /dev/sda2 has 148.52GiB 
of space, all of which has been totally allocated to a volume group named vg_abc.
