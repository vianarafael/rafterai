From the Windows 9x desktop, 
 double-click the Network Neighborhood icon. (From Windows 2000 or XP, double-click the 
My Network Places icon.)

With Windows Vista, you open the Network icon. The name of your host computer 
(the NetBIOS name, which is probably also your TCP/IP name) appears on the screen or 
within a workgroup folder on the screen. Open the icon that represents your computer.
