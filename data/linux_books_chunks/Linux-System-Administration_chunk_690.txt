These can also be used when the
system is running to start and stop daemons (or services). Most of them accept the following
parameters: start, stop, restart, status.

For example in this screenshot we restart the samba daemon.

root@laika:~# /etc/init.d/samba restart
 * Stopping Samba daemons...                               [ OK ] 
 * Starting Samba daemons...
