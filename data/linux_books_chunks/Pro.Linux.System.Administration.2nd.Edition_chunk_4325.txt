For each file we copy and paste 
them into the gateway.example.com.cert and cacert.pem files to the following directories:

[ca.example.come] $ sudo cat gateway.example.com.cert
[gateway.example.com] $ sudo vi /etc/pki/tls/certs/gateway.example.com.cert
[ca.example.come] $ sudo cat certs/cacert.pem
[gateway.example.com] $ vi /etc/pki/tls/certs/cacerts.pem

Then on the gateway host we make sure we move the private key to the proper directory.

[gateway.example.com] $ sudo mv gateway.example.com.key /etc/pki/tls/private/gateway.
example.com.key

In the previous lines, we have copied our TLS certificates to their proper locations on our gateway host, 
including the CAâ€™s root certificate, cacert.pem.
