Using the rndc 

utility again we can issue the following command:

$ sudo rndc querylog on

If we tail the /var/log/syslog (on Ubuntu) we will see the following:

Jun 28 12:23:26 localhost named[2548]: received control channel command 'querylog on'
Jun 28 12:23:26 localhost named[2548]: query logging is now on

We will now be able to see the DNS queries in the system log as follows:

Jun 28 12:25:31 localhost named[2548]: client 127.0.0.1#47616 (1.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa): 
query: 1.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa IN PTR + (127.0.0.1)

To turn off the query logging we simply issue the following:

$ sudo rndc querylog off

448

We’ll add the period now and increment the zone serial number and the records should now look as 

follows:

Chapter 10 ■ InfrastruCture servICes: ntp, Dns, DhCp, anD ssh 

$ORIGIN 0.168.192.in-addr.arpa.
