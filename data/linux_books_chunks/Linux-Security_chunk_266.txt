Below a screenshot of a character device (the console) and a block device (the hard disk).

paul@debian6lt~$ ls -ld /dev/console /dev/sda
crw-------   1 root root  5, 1 Mar 15 12:45 /dev/console
brw-rw----   1 root disk  8, 0 Mar 15 12:45 /dev/sda

And here you can see a directory, a regular file and a symbolic link.

paul@debian6lt~$ ls -ld /etc /etc/hosts /etc/motd
drwxr-xr-x 128 root root 12288 Mar 15 18:34 /etc
-rw-r--r--   1 root root   372 Dec 10 17:36 /etc/hosts
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root root    13 Dec  5 10:36 /etc/motd -> /var/run/motd
