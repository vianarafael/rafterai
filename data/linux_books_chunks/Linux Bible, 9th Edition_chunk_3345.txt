The following is an example of some chown settings you 
could put in your vsftpd.conf ﬁ le to use with your anonymous upload directory:

chown_uploads=YES
chown_username=joe

If an anonymous user were to upload a ﬁ le after vsftpd was restarted with these settings, 
the uploaded ﬁ le would be owned by the user joe and the ftp group.
