After that, you turn it back on again (ifup 
lo) and check again to see that it is on (ifconfig).

In addition to conﬁ guring the primary network interfaces, you can also create ﬁ les in the 
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts directory that can be used to set aliases (multiple 
IP addresses for the same interface), bonded interfaces (multiple NICs listening on the same 
address), and custom routes.
