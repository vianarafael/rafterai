to 7 p.m.
Time periods are used in number of places in Nagios, but most commonly they specify when hosts and 
services should be checked and when notifications (messages generated when hosts and services fail or vary 
from their required state) should be sent.

The next attribute, max_check_attempts, specifies the number of times Nagios checks a host or service 

before determining that there is a problem.

The check_interval specifies how long between checks, and if there is a failure, we can use retry_

interval to check more or less frequently.

Commands

The last attribute, check_command, tells Nagios what command to use to check the hostâ€™s status, in this case 
check-host-alive.

This is one of the commands we discussed earlier.
