Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any 
applicable law fulﬁ lling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted 
on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such 
measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of 
technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights 
under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to 
limit operation or modiﬁ cation of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s 
users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.
