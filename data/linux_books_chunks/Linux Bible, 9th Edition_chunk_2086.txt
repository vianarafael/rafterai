You then check to make 
sure that the mount succeeded.

# mkdir /mnt/test
# mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/test
# df -h /mnt/test
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sdc1             7.4G   17M  7.0G   1% /mnt/test
# mount | grep sdc1
/dev/sdc1 on /mnt/test type ext4 (rw)

The df command shows that /dev/sdc1 is mounted on /mnt/test and that 
it offers about 7.4GB of disk space.
