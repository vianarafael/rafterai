Client Run After Job also requires a 
successful completion of the script or command on the target host; otherwise, it stops further processing for 
that job and submits an error message. If we did not want to use the Python plug-ins, we could write our own 
scripts. To use these, we could change the headoffice.example.com Job resource we defined earlier.
