This chapter covers both RPM (Fedora and Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux) and (to some extent) DEB packaging and software management.

Debian software packages hold multiple ﬁ les and metadata related to some set of software in 
the format of an ar archive ﬁ le. The ﬁ les can be executables (commands),  conﬁ guration ﬁ les, 
documentation, and other software items.
