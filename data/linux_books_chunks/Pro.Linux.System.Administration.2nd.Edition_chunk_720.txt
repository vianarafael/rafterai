In this chapter, we’re going to explain a bit more about 
what happens when you log in, and we’ll begin to explore some of the options and security controls that you 
can manage as part of this process.

So what actually happens after you enter your username and password and before you are delivered to 
your command-line prompt or graphical user interface (GUI) screen? Well, this process varies slightly from 
distribution to distribution, but generally an application called login is executed and performs the following 
actions:

•	 Checks that the user and group exist and the user is allowed to log in

•	 Checks that the user is allowed to log in from a particular location (e.g., only some 

users can log in to the console, or the screen attached to a Linux host)

•	 Checks that the password is correct, and, if the password is incorrect, allows a 

specified number (usually three) of retries

•	 Checks that the password is valid and prompts the user for a new password if it has 

expired

•

Sets environment variables like the user’s home directory and path
