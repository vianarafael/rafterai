Remember that a target 
unit is simply a grouping of other units, as shown in the preceding example. Also notice 
that the units in this group are not all service units. There are path units and other target 
units as well.

A target unit has both Wants and requirements, called Requires. A Wants means that all 
the units listed are triggered to activate (start).
