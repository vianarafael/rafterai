In fact, it’s a good idea to develop the habit of running 
this every time you make a conﬁ guration change:

# apachectl configtest
Syntax OK
# apachectl graceful
/usr/sbin/apachectl graceful: httpd gracefully restarted

In the event of a syntax error, apachectl indicates where the error occurs and also does 
its best to give a hint about the nature of the problem.
