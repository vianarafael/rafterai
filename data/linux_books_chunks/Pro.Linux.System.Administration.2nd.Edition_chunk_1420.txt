We can now validate that our bonded interface is 
working correctly by looking at the special /proc/net/bonding/bond0 file.

$ sudo cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0

Bonding Mode: fault-tolerance (active-backup)
Primary Slave: None
Currently Active Slave: enp0s8
MII Status: up
MII Polling Interval (ms): 100

That is part of the output from the cat command against that file.
