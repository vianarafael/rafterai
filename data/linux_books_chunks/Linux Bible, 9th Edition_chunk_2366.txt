This remote logging feature is particularly handy because it enables you to centralize the 
management and review of the log ﬁ les from many systems on your network. There is also a 
major security beneﬁ t to this practice.

With remote logging, if a system on your network is broken into, the cracker cannot delete 
or modify the log ﬁ les because those ﬁ les are stored on a separate computer.
