We do that with the following command:

$ sudo gluster volume create vol1 replica 3 \
       au-mel-dfs-1:/data/brick1_r1/vol1 \
       au-mel-dfs-2:/data/brick1_r1/vol1 \
       au-mel-dfs-3:/data/brick1_r1/vol1
volume create: vol1: success: please start the volume to access data

620

We have created a new Gluster volume called vol1. It is going to replicate each file over the three bricks.
