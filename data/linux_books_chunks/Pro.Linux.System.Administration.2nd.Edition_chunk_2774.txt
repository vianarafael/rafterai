We can use the 
PoxyCommand in the SSH config to configure a jump host.

Host jumphost
  Hostname jumphost.foo.com

Host private.foo.com
  Hostname 10.0.1.1
  ForwardAgent yes
  ProxyCommand ssh -qxT jumphost nc %h %p

To make a connection to private.foo.com, we first set up a proxying connection to jumphost.
