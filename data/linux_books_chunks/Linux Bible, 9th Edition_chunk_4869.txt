QEMU provides features that make it appear to each virtual machine 
as though it is running on physical hardware.

 ■ Libvirt Service Daemon (libvirtd)—A single libvirtd service runs on each 
hypervisor. The libvirtd daemon listens for requests to start, stop, pause, and 
otherwise manage virtual machines on a hypervisor.
