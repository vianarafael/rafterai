For instance, to check how likely your host is to use swap memory, you can check the contents of /
proc/sys/vm/swappiness.

$ cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
30

This particular value is an indication of how likely the kernel is to move information from RAM into 
swap space after it hasnâ€™t been used for a while. The higher the number, the more likely this is.
