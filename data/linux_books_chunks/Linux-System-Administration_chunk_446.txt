raid 2, 3 and 4 ?

raid 2 uses bit level striping, raid 3 byte level, and raid 4 is the same as raid 5, but with a
dedicated parity disk. This is actually slower than raid 5, because every write would have
to write parity to this one (bottleneck) disk. It is unlikely that you will ever see these raid
levels in production.

10.2.5. raid 5

raid 5 uses three or more disks, each divided into chunks.
