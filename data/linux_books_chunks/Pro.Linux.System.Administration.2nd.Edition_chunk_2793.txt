Using scp to Transfer a File to a Remote Host

$ scp data.txt jsmith@au-mel-centos-1:/tmp
data.txt                                        100% 3072KB    3.0MB/s    00:00

Because we had sent our public SSH key to au-mel-centos-1 previously, scp was able to use the SSH 

agent to authenticate and we werenâ€™t asked for a password.
