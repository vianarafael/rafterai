Using the 
netstat command, you can see the resulting processes that are listening on those 
assigned ports:

tcp  0  0 0.0.0.0:49001   0.0.0.0:*    LISTEN    4682/rpc.rquotad
tcp  0  0 0.0.0.0:49002   0.0.0.0:*    LISTEN    -            
tcp  0  0 0.0.0.0:49004   0.0.0.0:*    LISTEN    4698/rpc.mountd
tcp  0  0 :::49002        :::*         LISTEN    -            
tcp  0  0 :::49004        :::*         LISTEN    4698/rpc.mountd
udp  0  0 0.0.0.0:49001   0.0.0.0:*              4682/rpc.rquotad
udp  0  0 0.0.0.0:49003   0.0.0.0:*              -            
udp  0  0 0.0.0.0:49004   0.0.0.0:*              4698/rpc.mountd
udp  0  0 :::49003        :::*                   -            
udp  0  0 :::49004        :::*                   4698/rpc.mountd

With those port numbers set and being used by the various services, you can now add 
 iptables rules, as you did with ports 2049 and 111 for the basic NFS service.

Chapter 20: Confi guring an NFS File Server

Allowing NFS access in TCP wrappers
For services such as vsftpd and sshd, TCP wrappers in Linux enable you to add 
 information to /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny Ô¨Å les to indicate which hosts 
can or cannot access the service.
