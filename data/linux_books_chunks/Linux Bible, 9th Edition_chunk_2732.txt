In other words, 
when the multi-user.target unit is activated, the sshd service unit is started.

You can view the various units that a target unit will activate by using the following 
command:

# systemctl show --property "Wants" multi-user.target
Wants=multipathd.service avahi-daemon.service sshd-keygen.se
(END) q

Unfortunately, the systemctl command does not format the output for this well.
