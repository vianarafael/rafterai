bootloader

This  chapter  briefly  discusses  the  boot  sequence  of  an  (Intel  32-bit  or  64-bit)  Linux
computer.

Systems booting with lilo are rare nowadays, so this section is brief.

The most common bootloader on Linux systems today is grub, yet this is not a Linux project.
Distributions like FreeBSD and Solaris also use grub.

Likewise, grub is not limited to Intel architecture.
