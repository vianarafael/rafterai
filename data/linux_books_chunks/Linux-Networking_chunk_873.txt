Remember, our server is still accessible to everyone, nobody needs to
know this user account or password. We just want a clean Linux server.

To accomplish this, we first have to tell Samba about this user. We can do this by adding
the account to smbpasswd.

[root@RHEL52 samba]# smbpasswd -a sambanobody
New SMB password:
Retype new SMB password:
Added user sambanobody.
