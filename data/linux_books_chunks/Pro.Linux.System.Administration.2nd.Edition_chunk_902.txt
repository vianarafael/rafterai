Four major 
management groups are available in PAM, and they represent the different portions of the authentication

password: These modules set passwords, for example, checking to ensure your 
password is sufficiently strong.

session: These modules check, manage, and configure user sessions.

Usually one or more modules are assigned to each management group, and these modules are usually 

checked in the order they are specified, and each module will return either a success or failure result.
