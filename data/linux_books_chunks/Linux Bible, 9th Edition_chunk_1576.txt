If you have a text-only console, or if the GUI isnâ€™t working properly, you can run an 
installation in plain-text mode: By typing text, you cause the installation to run in text mode.

If you want to start installation on one computer, but you want to answer the installation 
questions from another computer, you can enable a vnc (virtual network computing) instal-
lation.
