They don’t check the 
nsswitch.conf ﬁ le to ﬁ nd other places to query, such as the local hosts ﬁ le. For that, you 
would have to use the getent command. For example:

# getent hosts node1
192.168.0.201  node1

14

This getent example ﬁ nds a host named node1 that was entered into my local 
/etc/hosts ﬁ le.
