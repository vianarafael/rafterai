/sbin/shutdown

The shutdown command is used to properly shut down a system.

Common switches used with shutdown are -a, -t, -h and -r.

The  -a  switch  forces  /sbin/shutdown  to  use  /etc/shutdown.allow.  The  -t  switch  is  used
to define the number of seconds between the sending of the TERM signal and the KILL
signal. The -h switch halts the system instead of changing to runlevel 1.
