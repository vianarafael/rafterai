Editing Files with vim and vi
It’s almost impossible to use Linux for any period of time and not need a text editor because, as 
noted earlier, most Linux conﬁ guration ﬁ les are plain-text ﬁ les that you will almost certainly need 
to change manually at some point.

If you are using a GNOME desktop, you can run gedit (type gedit into the Search box and press 
Enter, or select Applications ➪ Accessories ➪ gedit), which is fairly intuitive for editing text.
