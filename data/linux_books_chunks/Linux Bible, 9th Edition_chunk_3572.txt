Figure 20.1 illustrates a Linux ﬁ le server using NFS to share (export) a ﬁ lesystem and a cli-

FIGURE 20.1

NFS can make selected fi lesystems available to other computers.

/etc/exports ﬁle:
/apps/bin pins(rw) maple(rw) spruce(rw)

# mount -t nfs oak:/apps/bin /oak/apps

In this example, a computer named oak makes its /apps/bin directory available to  clients 
on the network (pine, maple, and spruce) by adding an entry to the /etc/exports ﬁ le.
