(If you see a capital S or T instead of the execute 
bits on a directory, it means that the set GID or stick bit permission, respectively, 
was set, but for some reason the execute bit was not also turned on.)

Identifying Directories
When you need to identify your home directory on a shell command line, you can use the following:

 ■ $HOME—This environment variable stores your home directory name.

 ■ ~—The tilde (~) represents your home directory on the command line.

You can also use the tilde to identify someone else’s home directory.
