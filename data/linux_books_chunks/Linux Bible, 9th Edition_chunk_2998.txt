To enable raw printing in CUPS, uncomment the following line in the /etc/cups/mime.
types fi le in Linux:

application/octet-stream

and uncomment the following line in the /etc/cups/mime.convs fi le:

application/octet-stream application/vnd.cups-raw 0 -

After that, you can print fi les as raw data to your printers without using the -oraw option to print commands.

supports many of the old commands for working with printing.
