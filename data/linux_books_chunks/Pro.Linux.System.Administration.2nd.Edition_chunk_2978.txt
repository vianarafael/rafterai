On CentOS, mariadb writes to the /var/log/mariadb/mariadb.log file; on Ubuntu, it uses the /var/
log/syslog file.

Note that we have not tuned the MariaDB server for high-end performance; weâ€™ve just modified the 

basic configuration to give us better data integrity and to perform a bit better than it would normally.
