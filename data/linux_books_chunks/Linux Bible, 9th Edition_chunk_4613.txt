The following is an example of the SELinux policy rules with Booleans on a Fedora Linux 
system:

# getsebool -a
abrt_anon_write --> off
abrt_handle_event --> off
...
xserver_object_manager --> off
zabbix_can_network --> off

To see a speciﬁ c policy that can be modiﬁ ed by a Boolean, the getsebool command is 
used again.
