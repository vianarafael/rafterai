However, if SELinux is in Enforcing mode, a few SELinux issues could cause 
your vsftpd server to not behave as you would like. Use the following commands to check 
the state of SELinux on your system:

# getenforce
Enforcing
# grep ^SELINUX= /etc/sysconfig/selinux
SELINUX=enforcing

The getenforce command shows how SELinux is currently set (here, itâ€™s in Enforcing 
mode).
