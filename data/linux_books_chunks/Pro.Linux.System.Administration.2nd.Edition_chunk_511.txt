The systemd process is the base process on Linux hosts 
that spawns all other processes on a host. This master process always uses PID 1 and must be running for 
your host to be functional.

 ■ Note 
 Depending on the operating system you have chosen you might notice that you don’t have a 
systemd process but an init process instead at pID 1.
