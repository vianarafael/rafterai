You can do this by typing several commands on the same 
command line and separating them with semicolons (;):

$ date ; troff -me verylargedocument | lpr ; date

In this example, I was formatting a huge document and wanted to know how long it would 
take. The Ô¨Å rst command (date) showed the date and time before the formatting started.
