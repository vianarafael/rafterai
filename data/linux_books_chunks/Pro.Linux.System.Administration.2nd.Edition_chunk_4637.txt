The issuing certificate file 
is added to the cacert.pem file. We have also specified allow for TLSVerifyClient. This means that we 
will verify any client certificates presented to us during the TLS exchange but not fail if we canâ€™t verify the 
certificate. Other options are never, allow, try, and demand.
