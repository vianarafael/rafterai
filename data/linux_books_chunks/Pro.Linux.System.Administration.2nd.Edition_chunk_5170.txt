Make lists of the critical messages that are important to you and your hosts.

Group those lists into priority listings; some messages you may want to be paged for, others can go via 

e-mail, and some may trigger automated processes or generate attempts at self-recovery such as restarting a 
process.

The third stage is implementing your log correlation and analysis, including configuring your 

correlation tools and designing the required responses.
