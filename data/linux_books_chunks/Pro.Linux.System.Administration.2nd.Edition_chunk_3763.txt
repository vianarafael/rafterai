The option root_squash means that the root user on the remote host has the UID/
GID set to the anonymous UID/GID—which means this user’s root powers are valid on this share. This is to 
protect the network mount from being compromised by the remote root user.

The fsid option identifies the filesystem that NFS is exporting.
