The output from sed goes to stdout, so this command 
 redirects the output to a ﬁ le for safekeeping.

$ sed 's/Mac/Linux/g' somefile.txt > fixed_file.txt

You can get the same result using a pipe:

$ cat somefile.txt | sed 's/Mac/Linux/g' > fixed_file.txt

By searching for a pattern and replacing it with a null pattern, you delete the original 
pattern.
