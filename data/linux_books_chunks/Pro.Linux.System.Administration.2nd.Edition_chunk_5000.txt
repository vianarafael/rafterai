To list 

all current settings, we can use the following:

$ sysctl –a
abi.vsyscall32 = 1
crypto.fips_enabled = 0
debug.exception-trace = 1
debug.kprobes-optimization = 1
dev.hpet.max-user-freq = 64
dev.mac_hid.mouse_button2_keycode = 97
...
vm.percpu_pagelist_fraction = 0
vm.stat_interval = 1
vm.swappiness = 30
vm.user_reserve_kbytes = 29608
vm.vfs_cache_pressure = 100
vm.zone_reclaim_mode = 0

To read a particular value, pass its key as a parameter to sysctl.

$ sudo sysctl vm.swappiness
vm.swappiness = 30
