BIOS reads from a small section of a hard drive (the master boot record, or MBR) to load the operating system. 
UEFI instead reads from a special FAT32 partition created at installation time and is not limited to 512 bytes. 
Also UEFI requires that the partition table on the disk is GPT (GUID Partition Table), and this means that we 
can boot off disks over 2TiB in size.
