The async_abor_enable=YES setting ensures that some FTP clients that might hang 
when aborting a transfer will not hang.

The following settings have an impact on performance:

# Performance
one_process_model=YES
idle_session_timeout=120
data_connection_timeout=300
accept_timeout=60
connect_timeout=60
anon_max_rate=50000

With one_process_model=YES set, performance can improve because vsftpd launches 
one process per connection.
