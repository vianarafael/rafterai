Here is an example of 
an NFSMount_Global_Options block:

[ NFSMount_Global_Options ]
# This sets the default version to NFS 4
Defaultvers=4
# Sets the number of times a request will be retried before
# generating a timeout
Retrans=2
# Sets the number of minutes before retrying a failed
# mount to 2 minutes
# Retry=2

In the example just shown, the default NFS version is 4.
