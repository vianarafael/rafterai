(This is 
an alias that is often set automatically for the root user. Instead of just removing ﬁ les, you 
are prompted for each individual ﬁ le removal. This prevents you from automatically remov-
ing all the ﬁ les in a directory by mistakenly typing something such as rm *.)

While you are in the shell, you can check which aliases are set by typing the alias com-
mand.
