After 
the service is up and running and the ﬁ rewall is properly conﬁ gured, you should be able to 
use ssh client commands to access your system via the ssh server.

Any further conﬁ gurations for what the sshd daemon is allowed to do are handled in the
/etc/ssh/sshd_config ﬁ le. At a minimum, change the PermitRootLogin setting from 
yes to no.
