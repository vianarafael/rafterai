Taking a look at Collectd, we want to see the following in our logs:

Nov 22 23:19:06 backup collectd[5999]: plugin_load: plugin "write_graphite" successfully 
loaded.

On our relay host, we want to see our hosts connecting to us in the /var/log/carbon/listener.log.

22/11/2016 12:29:56 :: MetricLineReceiver connection with 192.168.0.30:38309 established

821

Chapter 17 â–  performanCe monitoring and optimization

Then on our monitor host, we want to see this in the /var/log/carbon/listener.log.

20/11/2016 10:19:03 :: MetricPickleReceiver connection with 192.168.0.251:52146 established

So, we can see from our logs that our connections are being established between our Collectd service 
running on our backup host to our relay to our monitor.
