After possibilities are 
displayed, the original command line returns, ready for you to complete it as you choose. 
For example, if you typed another P and pressed Tab again, the command line would be 
completed with $PPID (the only unique possibility).

Command-line recall
After you type a command line, the entire command line is saved in your shellâ€™s 
history list.
