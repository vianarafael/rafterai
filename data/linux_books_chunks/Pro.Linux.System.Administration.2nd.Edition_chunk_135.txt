You may have in your network a 
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server already. A DHCP server is a service that assigns IP 
addresses to MAC addresses (the special and unique address on your network card). Most offices and 
homes now have DHCP servers in their firewall or routers on their network.
