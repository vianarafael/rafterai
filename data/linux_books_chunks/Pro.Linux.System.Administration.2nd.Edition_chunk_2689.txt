ip address of 192.168.100.1/24, and we have a subnet declared in dhcpd.conf of 192.168.100.0/24 – the

We save the file and then start the server using sudo system start isc-dhcp-server on Ubuntu or 

sudo systemclt start dhcpd on CentOS.

When the server assigns a lease to a specific client, it records the client MAC (Media Access Control) 
address and the assigned lease to a file.
