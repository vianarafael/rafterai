To do this, the command needs to write to the password file, a file that has restricted access. 
By adding the setuid permission, a user can execute the passwd command and run it as if she were the 
root user, hence allowing her to change her password.

You can recognize setuid and setgid permissions by the use of an s or S in the listing of permissions.
