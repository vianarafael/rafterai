Currently, we have two paths from our branch offices to our head 

office. The first is across the 10.0.2.0/24 network you saw in Chapter 7. This is our DSL or ASDL (or similar 
type) Internet connection between our offices and the Internet. Each individual office will generally have an 
individual Internet connection.
