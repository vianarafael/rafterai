BCM covers various aspects 
of your organization and should detail timelines that your business agrees upon for the restoration of 
particular services.

The following are questions to consider when formulating your organization’s BCM and DRP strategy:

•	 Can we predict the most likely disruptions our business could face? What are the 

steps required to recover from them? What are timelines for expected recovery?

•	 What are the costs associated with mitigating the risks for and recovering from each 

potential event?

•	 Do we need a co-location where we can move our business?

•	 Do we need to rent extra equipment, such as power generators, in any potential 

crisis scenario?

•	 Who are the people and organizations that need to reached/communicated 

with in the event of disruption to the business? How should the disruption be 
communicated to the public?

•	

In the case of a large-scale catastrophic event, what are the points that determine 
whether continuation of the business can be achieved? Losses can quickly 
accumulate if key infrastructure or business assets are disrupted.

Developing BCM and DRP plans can be a complex process.
