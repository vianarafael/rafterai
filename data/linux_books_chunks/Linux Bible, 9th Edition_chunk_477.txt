By default, the top panel contains menu buttons (Applications, Places, and 
System), desktop application launchers (Evolution email and Firefox web browser), a 
workspace switcher (for managing four virtual desktops), and a clock. Icons appear in 
the panel when you need software updates or SELinux detects a problem.
