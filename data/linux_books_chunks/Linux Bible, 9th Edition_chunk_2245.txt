Often, there is a primary conﬁ guration ﬁ le; sometimes, there is a related 
conﬁ guration directory in which ﬁ les ending in .conf can be pulled into the main 
 conﬁ guration ﬁ le.

The httpd package (Apache web server) is an example of a server package that has a 
 primary conﬁ guration ﬁ le and a directory where other conﬁ guration ﬁ les can be dropped in 
and be included with the service.
