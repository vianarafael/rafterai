If 

we wanted to set the DNS configuration of our client, we might use an up script, tunnelup.sh, like this:

#!/bin/sh
mv /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.bak
echo "search example.org" > /etc/resolv.conf
echo "nameserver 10.0.2.155" >> /etc/resolv.conf exit 0

We could then use a down script, tunneldown.sh, to revert our configuration options, like so:

#!/bin/sh
mv /etc/resolv.conf.bak /etc/resolv.conf

 You need to transfer these scripts to the client yourself or use a configuration management tool, as 

 ■ Note 
we’ll show you in Chapter 19.

Lastly, we can force all traffic from the client to the VPN.
