_____________________________________________________

The mkisofs tool can take a boot image (floppy or hard disk) and add the image in the 
root directory of th CDROM (usually boot/).

Using disk emulation

Assuming we are creating the CD in a directory called CD-root, we can create the 
bootable disk image with dd.

dd  if=/path/to/boot/image  of=<CD-root>/boot/boot.img

The iso-image is then created with the following command:

mkisofs -b boot/boot.img -c boot/boot.catalog -o boot-cd.iso .

Alternatives without disk emulation

It is possible to make a bootable CD using the ISOLINUX bootloader.
