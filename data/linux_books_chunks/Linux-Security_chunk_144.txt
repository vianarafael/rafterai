These tools have a look and feel that depends
on  the  distribution.  If  you  are  a  novice  Linux  user  on  your  home  system,  then  use  the
graphical tool that is provided by your distribution. This will make sure that you do not run
into problems.

Another option is to use command line tools like useradd, usermod, gpasswd, passwd and
others.
