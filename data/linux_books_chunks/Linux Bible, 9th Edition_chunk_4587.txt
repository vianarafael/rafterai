The example 
that follows shows you how to use secon to view the current and the systemd process’s 
security context.

# secon -urt
user: unconfined_u
role: unconfined_r
type: unconfined_t
# secon -urt -p 1
user: system_u
role: system_r
type: init_t

To view a ﬁ le’s security context, you use the -f option, as shown here:

# secon -urt -f /etc/passwd
user: system_u
role: object_r
type: etc_t

A user’s security context is not viewed using the secon command.
