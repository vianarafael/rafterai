You will need to edit /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf.

mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir

This tells Dovecot we’re using Maildirs located in the user’s home directory, or ~, and in the directory 

Maildir.

Now we need to restart the Dovecot server, and then we can test to see whether we can make a 

connection and retrieve our e-mail on our server, for example:

$ sudo systemctl restart dovecot

Testing Dovecot

Now that we’ve configured Dovecot, we can enable a client and test its access.
