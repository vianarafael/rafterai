For example, if you were to hand the ﬁ le to 
another user, that user could run gpg2 with the -d option and provide the passphrase for 
the secret key.

$ gpg2 -d --force-mdc /tmp/backup.tar.gz.gpg > /tmp/backup.tar.gz
<A pop-up window asks for your passphrase>
gpg: CAST5 encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
This is my secret message.
...

The result is that the original tar ﬁ le is decrypted and copied to /tmp/backup.tar.gz.
