On a system with 
SELinux, a process is also given a security context.

24

How a process gets its security context depends upon which process started it. Remember 
that systemd (previously init) is the “mother” of all processes (see Chapter 15). Thus, 
many daemons and processes are started by systemd. The processes systemd starts 
are given new security contexts.
