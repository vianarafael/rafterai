Many Linux applications and desktop environments use fi le suffi xes to determine the contents 
of a fi le. In Linux, however, DOS command extensions such as .com, .exe, and .bat don’t 
necessarily signify an executable. (Permission fl ags make Linux fi les executable.)

 ■ Every fi le and directory in a Linux system has permissions and ownership associated with it.
