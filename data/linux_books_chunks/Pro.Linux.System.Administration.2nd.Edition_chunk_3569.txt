We do that by editing the main.cf file again.

smtpd_milters = unix:/var/run/clamav-milter/clamav-milter.socket unix:/var/spool/opendkim/
opendkim.socket

We will add the opendkim group to the postfix user.

$ sudo usermod â€“aG opendkim postfix

We then will need to fix our SELinux policy.
We can restart Postfix now too.

$ sudo systemctl restart postfix

We can now send ourselves an e-mail to one of our external addresses.
