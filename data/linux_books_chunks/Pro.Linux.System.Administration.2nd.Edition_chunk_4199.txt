Once these are installed, we will edit the /etc/
bareos/bareos-fd.conf file and add the following information:

Director {
FileDaemon {                          # definition of myself
  Name = headoffice-fd
  WorkingDirectory = /var/lib/bareos
  Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 20

  # remove comment from "Plugin Directory" to load plugins from specified directory.
  # if "Plugin Names" is defined, only the specified plugins will be loaded,
  # otherwise all storage plugins (*-fd.so) from the "Plugin Directory".
  #
  # Plugin Directory = /usr/lib64/bareos/plugins
  # Plugin Names = ""

  # if compatible is set to yes, we are compatible with bacula
  # if set to no, new bareos features are enabled which is the default
  # compatible = yes
}

#
# List Directors who are permitted to contact this File daemon
#
Director {
  Name = example-dir
  Password = "6rZQQqVsOJeeTPefrG2AslT5ODxtPWO1hNsd7Re1u6J/"
}

#
# Restricted Director, used by tray-monitor to get the
#   status of the file daemon
#
Director {
  Name = example-mon
  Password = "WOhEm9JC+uBvpNBJta1RuA7NJSmUgQrz3QPRgPYhRzyZ"
  Monitor = yes
}

# Send all messages except skipped files back to Director
Messages {
  Name = Standard
  director = example-dir = all, !skipped, !restored
}

In the File daemon configuration script, we declare the Director {} stanza for connecting to the Bareos 

Director daemon.
