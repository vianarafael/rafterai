Each of these configuration blocks starts with a Host 
directive, which is followed by a hostname or a shortened alias if the section should apply to a single host 
only, or an asterisk if it should apply to all hosts.

For instance, we can easily customize our connection options for the bastion host by adding the 

following snippet to our .ssh/config file.

Host gateway
    Hostname au-mel-centos-1
    Port 2022
    User ataylor

This configuration is used each time we use the ssh gateway command.
