Letâ€™s take a look at one now.

---
- hosts: ahostgroup
  become: true
  gather_facts: true
  vars:
    - akey: avalue
  tasks:
    - name: do something
       module: module=arguments
  handlers:
  - name: a handler
    module: module=arguments

This is a basic playbook layout. We declare the key hosts and give it a value of the hosts we want to run 
this on, either a group or an individual host.
