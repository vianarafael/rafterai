Once this is done the e2fsadm

Extending the Volume Group with a RAID 0 device

So far we have:

VG = /dev/hda16  +  /dev/hda17  + /dev/hda18

and we would like to add a RAID0 device to

1. Create three more partitions (e.g /dev/hda19, /dev/hda20 and /dev/hda21) of size 50MB 
and of type “Linux raid autodetect” (fd) – reboot!

2.
