What  is  our  dns  server  doing  when  it
receives a query ?

root@debian7:~# nslookup
> server
Default server: 10.104.33.30
Address: 10.104.33.30#53
> linux-training.be
Server:         10.104.33.30
Address:        10.104.33.30#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   linux-training.be

This  is  the  output  of  tcpdump  udp  port  53  while  executing  the  above  query  for  linux-
training.be in nslookup.

root@debian7:~# tcpdump udp port 53
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 65535 bytes

You should find the following two lines in the output of tcpdump:

10.104.33.30.19381 > google-public-dns-a.google.com.domain: 18237+% [1au] A? \
linux-training.be.
