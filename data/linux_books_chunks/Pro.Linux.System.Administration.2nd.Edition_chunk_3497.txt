The file /etc/clamav/clamav-milter.conf needs the 

following:

MilterSocket inet:7357@localhost
OnInfected Accept
AddHeader Add

574

Again, for testing we are accepting infected files and adding the header. Also, for Ubuntu, we are going 

to set up the milter to listen on the loopback address instead of using a named socket like we did in the 
CentOS setup.
