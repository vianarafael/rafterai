The components of the Bareos are as follows:

•	

•	

•	

•	

•	

A Director daemon

A Storage daemon

A File daemon

A catalog of what has been backed up to where

A console to manage Bareos

The Bareos backup server itself requires at least these two daemons to be running: the Director daemon 

and the Storage daemon.

The Director daemon controls what will be backed up, when it will be backed up, and the location to 
which it will be backed up.
