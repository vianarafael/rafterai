The advantage of public clouds is that you don’t have to purchase and maintain 
your own cloud infrastructure.

 ■ Private cloud—With a private cloud, you put your own computing infrastructure in 
place (hypervisors, controllers, storage, network conﬁ guration, and so on). Setting 
up your own private cloud means taking on more up-front costs to own and main-
tain infrastructure.
