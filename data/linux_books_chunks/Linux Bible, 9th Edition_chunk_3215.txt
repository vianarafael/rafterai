You can then use the graceful 
restart option (apachectl graceful) to instruct Apache to reload its conﬁ guration 
 without disconnecting any active clients.

The graceful restart option in apachectl automatically tests the confi guration before sending the reload signal 
to apache, but getting in the habit of running the manual confi guration test after making any confi guration changes 
is still a good idea.

Some conﬁ guration problems pass the syntax tests performed by apachectl but cause the 
HTTP daemon to exit immediately after reloading its conﬁ guration.
