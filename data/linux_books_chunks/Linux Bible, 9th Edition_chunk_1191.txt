In the following example, the two pipes (||) indicate that 
if the directory being tested for doesnâ€™t exist (-d dirname), then make the directory 
(mkdir $dirname).

# [ test ] || action
# Perform simple single command if test is false
dirname="/tmp/testdir"
[ -d "$dirname" ] || mkdir "$dirname"

Instead of pipes, you can use two ampersands to test if something is true.
