One can configure 
SAMBA to register on an existing network as a second WINS server by giving it the 
address of this server with the option:

wins server = <existing wins server> 

NOTICE

The options 'wins support' and 'wins server' are mutually exclusive.
The 'wins server' option registers the SAMBA server with an existing WINS server 
and enables WINS capabilities, there is no need to set 'wins support' as well.
