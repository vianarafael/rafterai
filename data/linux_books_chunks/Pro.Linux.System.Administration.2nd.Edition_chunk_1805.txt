kernel you can restart and select the older version and see if the problem persists.

Now your system is up to date. At the bottom you of Figure 8-13 you will see the “Last Checked:” time. 

This updates when you click the refresh button as in Figure 8-10. You can also choose to update your system 
from the command line.
