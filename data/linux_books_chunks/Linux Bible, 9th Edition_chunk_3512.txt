Chapter 19: Confi guring a Windows File Sharing (Samba) Server

The main point to remember is that, even though the share is not browseable, you can 
request it by giving the Samba server’s hostname or IP address, followed by the user’s name 
(here, chris), to access the user’s home directory.

Configuring the [printers] section
Any printer that you conﬁ gure for CUPS printing on your Linux system is automatically 
shared to others over Samba, based on the [printers] section that is added by default.
