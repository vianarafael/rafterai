The following 
section covers how to begin conﬁ guring SELinux to meet your particular organization’s 
security needs.

Confi guring SELinux
SELinux comes preconﬁ gured. You can use the SELinux features without any conﬁ gura-
tion work. However, rarely do the preconﬁ gured settings meet all your Linux system’s 
security needs.

SELinux conﬁ gurations can only be set and modiﬁ ed by the root user.
