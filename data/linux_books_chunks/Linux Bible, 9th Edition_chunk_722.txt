If you go to the shell 
from a Terminal window and you are using the original shell from that window, exiting 
causes the Terminal window to close. If you are at a virtual console, the shell exits and 
returns you to a login prompt.

If you have multiple shells open from the same shell session, exiting a shell simply returns 
you to the shell that launched the current shell.
