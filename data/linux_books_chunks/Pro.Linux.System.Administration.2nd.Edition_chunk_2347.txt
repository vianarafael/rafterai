You can still do so by removing /dev/md0 from the centos group via the vgreduce command:

$ sudo vgreduce centos /dev/md0
Removed "/dev/md0" from volume group "centos"

It is now available to be used for a different volume group, which you create using the vgcreate 
command. You will assign the /dev/md0 device to the new raid-volume volume group.
