We give anonymous clients, which are clients that 
have not made a bind connection (nonauthenticated), read access. Various applications can make use of the 
ou=hosts organizational unit including such applications as Samba.

The final rule we will have is a blanket denial rule. This will enforce the rejection of all other access.
