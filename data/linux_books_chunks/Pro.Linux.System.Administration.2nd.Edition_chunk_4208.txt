Issuing this 

command gives a detailed list of what is happening on the Bareos Director, including the attached Storage 
daemons and File daemons.

To find out what the Director itself is doing, we use the stat dir command. This command gives an 
overview of the pending jobs, the current running jobs, and the jobs that have been completed.
