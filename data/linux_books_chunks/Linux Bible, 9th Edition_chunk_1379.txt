Features in, or 
closely related to, the kernel include Udev (to dynamically name and create devices as 
hardware comes and goes) and HAL (to pass information about hardware changes to 
user space).

If all this sounds confusing, don’t worry. It’s designed to make your life as a Linux user 
much easier.
