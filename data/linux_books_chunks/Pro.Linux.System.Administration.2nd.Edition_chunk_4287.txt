Ubuntu is 
currently a few minor releases behind.

To view what version is currently available on your operating system, issue either of the following:

$ sudo aptitdue show openvpn (Ubuntu)
$ sudo yum info openvpn (CentOS)

On CentOS we first issue the installation of the EPEL repository, if it is not already installed, and then 

install the package.

$ sudo yum install epel-release
$ sudo yum install openvpn

On Ubuntu, you install the openvpn package, and some additional prerequisites will generally also be 

installed.

$ sudo aptitude install openvpn

Let’s look at stopping and starting the service now.
