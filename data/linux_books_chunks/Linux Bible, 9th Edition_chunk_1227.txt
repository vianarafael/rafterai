Create a script that reads in three positional parameters from the command line, 
assigns those parameters to variables named ONE, TWO, and THREE, respectively, 
and outputs that information in the following format:

There are X parameters that include Y.
The first is A, the second is B, the third is C.

Replace X with the number of parameters and Y with all parameters entered.
