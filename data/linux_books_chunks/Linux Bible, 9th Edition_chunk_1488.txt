Type any password you like, and then type it again in the Conﬁ rm 
box. Select Done to set the password. If the password is not at least six characters 
long or if it is considered to be too easy (like a common word), the installer doesn’t 
leave the password screen when you click Done. You can either change the  password 
or click Done again to have the installer use the password anyway.
