However most people use 
a centrally hosted Git repository service like GitLab, GitHub, or BitBucket and one of the first actions is to 
clone the repository:

$ git clone git@<githost.com>:<username>/git-repository.git

The foregoing command will log into the githost.com server using the SSH protocol (you can also 

use HTTPS, Git, or a local protocol).
