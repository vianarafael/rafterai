Let’s use certbot to create our certificates 
for www.example.com.

$ sudo certbot --test-cert –d www.example.com

Here we have issued certbot with the --test-cert argument, which will mean we will use the staging 
application programming interface (API) instead of the real endpoint for Let’s Encrypt.
