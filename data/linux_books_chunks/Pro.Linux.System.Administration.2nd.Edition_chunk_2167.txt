However, when youâ€™re using a 1 TiB filesystem, this limit would equate to 50 GiB 
of space that you could not use for storage of user data, so changing or removing it makes sense on data 
storage volumes.

You could have specified the -m 0 option for mkfs.ext4 to set this percentage of reserved blocks to 0 

when creating the filesystem, or you can change this value later (more on this shortly).

BLOCKS AND INODES

When you create a filesystem, the available disk space is divided into units of a specific size.
