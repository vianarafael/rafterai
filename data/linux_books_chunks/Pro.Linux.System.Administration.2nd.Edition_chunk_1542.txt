Combining all this information, we can use 

these commands in a script to bring up an interface, add an IP address, and add a route.

#!/bin/bash

# bring up the interface
ip link set enp0s8 up

# add an address
ip addr add 192.168.10.1/24 dev enp0s8

# add a route
ip route add 192.168.100.1 via 192.168.10.254 dev enp0s8

# ping the host
ping 192.168.100.1 –c 4

# bring down the route, remove the address and bring down the interface.
ip route del 192.168.100.1 via 192.168.10.254 dev enp0s8
ip addr del 192.168.10.1/24 dev enp0s8
ip link set enp0s8 down

exit 0

We have used the same command to control our interface, bringing it up, adding an address, and then 

adding a route.
