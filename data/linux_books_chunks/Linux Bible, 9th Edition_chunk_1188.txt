In the following example, if 
STRING is not Monday, then "At least it's not Monday" is echoed.

STRING="FRIDAY"
if [ "$STRING" != "Monday" ] ; then
   echo "At least it's not Monday"
fi

In the following example, elif (which stands for “else if”) is used to test for an additional 
condition (for example, whether filename is a ﬁ le or a directory).

filename="$HOME"
if [ -f "$filename" ] ; then
   echo "$filename is a regular file"
elif [ -d "$filename" ] ; then
   echo "$filename is a directory"
else
   echo "I have no idea what $filename is"
fi

As you can see from the preceding examples, the condition you are testing is placed 
between square brackets [ ].
