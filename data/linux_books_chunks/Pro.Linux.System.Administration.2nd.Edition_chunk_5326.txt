In this example, the value of the $USER1$ 
macro is the directory that contains the Nagios plug-ins.

$USER1$=/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins

The next part of the command is the Nagios plug-in the command will employ, check_ping, which uses 

ICMP pings to check the status of your host.

 ■ Note 

 this assumes your host’s firewall is configured to accept iCMp pings, as we discussed in Chapter 7.

In this command, you can see the use of one of Nagios’s macros, $HOSTADDRESS$, that you learned 
earlier contains the IP address of the host.
