Remember 

that on Ubuntu the TLS files will have a different path.

We handle authentications via our certificate names (x509/name). That means we verify our connection 

to our peer by testing their common name in their TLS certificate. If it matches the peer backup.example.
com, then we will permit the connection; if not, we will fail it.
