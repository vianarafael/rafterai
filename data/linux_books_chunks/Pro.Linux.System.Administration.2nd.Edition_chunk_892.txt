These checks are stacked together; for example, when logging 
in we check the user exists, then check that the user’s password is valid, and then that the password hasn’t 
expired. This stack is usually made up of multiple PAM modules, each of which performs some check 
function. Additionally, some checks must pass (e.g., your user must exist), and other checks may be optional.
