Letâ€™s now move on to creating our nightly backup with Duply.

Installing and Configuring Duply
Duply, as we have said, is the convenient way to manage our Duplicity backups. Duplicity can run multiple 
methods to securely back up files to remote systems. With AWS, it is going to copy our backup in file chunks 
of about 25Mb.
