Donâ€™t add a DHCP server on a network that is not under your control and that already has 
a working DHCP server. Many clients are set up to get address information from any DHCP 
server that will hand it out.

DHCP service is provided by the dhcp package in Fedora and RHEL. The service is named 
dhcpd in RHEL 6 and dhcpd.service in RHEL 7 and the latest Fedora release.
