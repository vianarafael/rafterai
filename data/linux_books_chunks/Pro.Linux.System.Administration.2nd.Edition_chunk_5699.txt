A Selector

  $ssh_service = $facts['os']['name'] ? {
        'CentOS' => 'sshd',
        'Ubuntu' => 'ssh',
        default => 'ssh',
    }

  service { $ssh_service:
    ensure => ‘running’,
  }

In Listing 19-12, we introduced a new type, service, that manages services on hosts. We’ve titled our 
service resource $ssh_service, and we’ve defined that variable just above it.
