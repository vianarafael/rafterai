The all_squash option causes all users (UIDs) and groups (GIDs) to be mapped 
to the user ID 65534 (which is the nfsnobody user in Fedora or RHEL and the nobody user 
in Ubuntu), giving them minimal permission to Ô¨Å les and directories.

The /home entry enables a set of users to have the same /home directory on different 
 computers.
