specific ip address

This is a screenshot that filters for dns packets that contain a certain ip address. The filter
in use is ip.addr==10.104.33.30 and dns. The and directive forces each displayed packet
to match both conditions.

Packet 93 is the dns query for the A record of linux-training.be. Packet 98 is the response
from the dns server.
