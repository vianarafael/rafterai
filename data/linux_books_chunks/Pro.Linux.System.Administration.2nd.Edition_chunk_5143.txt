To do this, you can rotate your logs.

Log rotation is the process of periodically copying the log file and usually adding a suffix like the date or 

an incrementing number. The rsyslog daemon then logs to a new file. You would usually keep rotated log 
files for a fixed period, for example, a week or a month.

Let’s look at an example. We’ve got the /var/log/mail.log file.
