With sudo su <user> you don’t need to know the password of the user you 
are trying to access as you are using privileges via sudo.

To use this command, you type sudo and then the command you want to execute. If you’re allowed 
to run sudo on that command, you’ll be prompted to input a password, usually your own user password.
