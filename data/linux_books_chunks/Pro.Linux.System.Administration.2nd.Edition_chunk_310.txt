Simply put, we can 
create a disk that will allocate the full size of disk we request or we can allocate only a small portion of that 
now, and as we need it, VirtualBox will allocate more of that space. The benefits of dynamic allocation are 
that you can overallocate your disk (meaning you can allocate more disk space to your virtual hosts than 
you actually have on your host).
