You can divide your disks into partitions of differing sizes depending on the 
requirements of your host. Again, as in the CentOS installation, you are prompted to either select one of 
several default partitioning options or customize your own using the partitioning tool.

•	 Guided—use entire disk: This option asks you to select a hard disk, which will be 
completely erased.
