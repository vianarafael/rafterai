If you are asked where to put the ISO, select a folder that has enough space to hold 
the ISO. Remember where this folder is because you need to locate the ISO when 
you go to burn it later.

After the download is complete, burn the ISO image to a DVD using procedures described in 
the “Creating Linux CDs and DVDs” section.

Other types of Ubuntu installation media are also available.
