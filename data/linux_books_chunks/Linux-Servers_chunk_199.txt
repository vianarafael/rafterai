This screenshot shows an example.

[root@CentOS65 ~]# cat /var/www/html/hunter2/.htaccess 
AuthUserFile /var/www/.htpasswd
AuthName "Members only!"
AuthType Basic
require valid-user

Note that we are protecting the website on port 9000 that we created earlier.

And because we put the website for the Hackerspace named hunter2 in a subdirectory of the
default website, we will need to adjust the AllowOvveride parameter in /etc/httpd/conf/
httpd.conf under the <Directory "/var/www/html"> directive as this screenshot shows.

# Possible values for the Options directive are "None", "All",
# or any combination of:
#   Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews
# 
# Note that "MultiViews" must be named *explicitly* --- "Options All"
# doesn't give it to you.
# 
# The Options directive is both complicated and important.
