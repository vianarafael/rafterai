To mount the Samba share on a Linux host, you 

would do something similar to the following:

$ sudo mount -t cifs //dc1.samba.example.com/sales /data/sales -o username=jsmith
Password for jsmith@\dc1.samba.example.com\sales:  *****************

This will mount the remote Samba share /data/staff/sales under the /data/sales directory. You 

pass the remote host and your username.
