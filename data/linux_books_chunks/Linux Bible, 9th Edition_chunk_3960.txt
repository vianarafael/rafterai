If you get to this point, it means your network connection is 
ﬁ ne and you should direct your troubleshooting efforts to how the service itself is conﬁ g-
ured (for example, you might look in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf to see if speciﬁ c 
hosts are allowed or denied access).

If TCP ports 80 and/or 443 are not shown, it means they are being ﬁ ltered.
