Using 
the restart option is also a good way to reread any conﬁ guration options you may have 
changed in the cupsd.conf ﬁ le (although, if CUPS is already running, service cups 
reload rereads conﬁ guration ﬁ les without restarting).

Part IV: Becoming a Linux Server Administrator

In Fedora 21 and RHEL 7, you use the systemctl command instead of service to start 
and stop services:

# systemctl status cups.service
* cups.service - CUPS Printing Service
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/cups.service; enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Sat 2016-07-23 22:41:05 EDT; 18h 
     ago
 Main PID: 20483 (cupsd)
   Status: "Scheduler is running..."
   CGroup: /system.slice/cups.service
           ├─20483 /usr/sbin/cupsd -f

You can tell the CUPS service is running because the status shows the cupsd daemon 
active with PID 20483.
