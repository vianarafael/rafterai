In fact all users that are
members of the admin group can use sudo to run all commands as root.

root@laika:~# grep admin /etc/sudoers 
# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

The end result of this is that the user can type sudo su - and become root without having to
enter the root password.
