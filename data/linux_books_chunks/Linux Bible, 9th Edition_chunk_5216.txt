To become root and edit the /etc/sudoers ﬁ le to allow your regular user account 
(for example, bill) to have full root privilege via the sudo command, do the 
following:

$ su -
Password: *********
# visudo
o
bill     ALL=(ALL)     ALL
Esc ZZ

Because visudo opens the /etc/sudoers ﬁ le in vi, the example types o to open a 
line, and then types in the line to allow bill to have full root privilege.
