If it becomes cumbersome to define all your nodes and their configuration in manifests, then you can use a 
feature known as external nodes to better scale this. External nodes allow you to store your nodes and their 
configuration in an external source.

The ENC runs as a command on the Puppet master and returns a YAML document describing the 

manifest for any particular node.
