The Create 
Samba Share window appears. Start by Ô¨Å lling in the folder name (select Choose to browse 
for it), a name to represent the share, and a description. Then you want to choose whether 
you want to let anyone write to it and whether you want the existence of the share to be 
visible to anyone.
