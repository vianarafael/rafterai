For example, if you 
authorize access to the /bin/* directory, then you will not be able to run any commands in the /bin/extra/ 
directory unless you explicitly define access to that directory, like the configuration on the next line:

ataylor au-mel-centos-1=/bin/*,/bin/extra/*

Sometimes you want to grant access to a particular command to a user, but you want that command to 
be run as another user.
