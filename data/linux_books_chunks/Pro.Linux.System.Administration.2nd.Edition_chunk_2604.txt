Our Service Records

IN      NS           ns.example.com.
IN      MX      10   mail.example.com.

The data for the MX record consists of a priority number and then the hostname that remote servers 
should try to deliver mail to. A properly configured remote mail server will work through a list of MX records, 
starting with the lowest priority number, and try to deliver e-mail.
