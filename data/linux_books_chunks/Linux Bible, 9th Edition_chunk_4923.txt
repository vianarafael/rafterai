Here, we are going to do the latter and create a VM 
from the Fedora 21 Workstation installation ISO image.

26

Assuming you are logged in to one of the hypervisors as root and the ISO image is in the 
current directory, copy the ISO to the default directory used by virt-manager for storage 
(/var/lib/libvirt/images):

# cp Fedora-Live-Workstation-x86_64-21-5.iso /var/lib/libvirt/images/

Because that directory is shared by both hypervisors, you can go to either hypervisor to 
use that image.

Step 2: Check the network bridge
On each hypervisor, there should be a default network bridge name virbr0.
