git changed that to be 
distributed so that you no longer had to rely on the “one” server to be available for all your teams to commit 
into. this greatly helped distributed teams to be able to make changes on very complex systems like the linux 
kernel and became a great way to collaborate on, and share, code and projects.

Downloading Git is very painless.
