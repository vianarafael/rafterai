Going into all the rules is probably overkill for a quick introduction to shell scripts, 
but the following list presents some common constructs you’re likely to see in bash scripts 
you ﬁ nd on your Linux system.

 ■ ${var:-value}—If variable is unset or empty, expand this to value.

 ■ ${var#pattern}—Chop the shortest match for pattern from the front of 

var’s value.

 ■ ${var##pattern}—Chop the longest match for pattern from the front of 

var’s value.

 ■ ${var%pattern}—Chop the shortest match for pattern from the end of var’s 

value.

 ■ ${var%%pattern}—Chop the longest match for pattern from the end of 

var’s value.

Part II: Becoming a Linux Power User

Try typing the following commands from a shell to test how parameter expansion works:

$ THIS="Example"
$ THIS=${THIS:-"Not Set"}
$ THAT=${THAT:-"Not Set"}
$ echo $THIS
Example
$ echo $THAT
Not Set

In the examples here, the THIS variable is initially set to the word Example.
