A pop-up should 

appear, asking what you want to do with the ISO.

3.  Select to save the ISO. Depending on your settings, either you are asked where you 
want to download it or it simply begins downloading to a default folder (in Linux, 
it is probably a Downloads folder).

4.  If you are prompted for where to put the ISO, select a folder that has enough space 
to hold it.
