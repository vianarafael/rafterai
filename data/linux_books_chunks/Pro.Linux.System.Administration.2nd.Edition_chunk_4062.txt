The backup 

started with several checks, then we read the exclude file, and then we started the backup. There was one 
file that was not successfully backed up (/var/lib/lxcfs, which is a docker view of the /proc filesystem 
cgroups and can be excluded too). Despite this, we had a successful backup.
