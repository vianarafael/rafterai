We are searching for two proxy files to be present.

$ grep -E '(proxy.so|fcgi)' /etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/00-proxy.conf
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
LoadModule proxy_fcgi_module modules/mod_proxy_fcgi.so

These modules are provided by the httpd package and apache2 package for CentOS and Ubuntu, 

respectively.

Next we are going to move off our /etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf file, as this is the configuration file for 

the php module.

$ sudo mv /etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf_bak

PHP-FPM is a daemon that will translate requests from the HTTP server and respond with an 
appropriate response from the PHP code.
