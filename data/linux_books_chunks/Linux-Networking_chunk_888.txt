configuring the share

We add the following [share] section to our smb.conf (and we do not forget to create the
directory /srv/samba/authwrite).

[authwrite]
path = /srv/samba/authwrite
comment = authenticated users only
read only = no
guest ok = no

20.5. testing access with net use

After restarting samba, we test with different users from within Microsoft computers.
