The proxy server can 
handle thousands of connections and acts as a buffer between the clients and the Gunicorn processes.

All that is required is for us to put the following graphite.conf file in a place where the Nginx server 

can find it:

upstream graphite {
    server 127.0.0.1:8881 fail_timeout=0;
}

server {
    server_name monitor;
    listen 80;
    root /var/www;

823

    location / {
        try_files $uri @graphite;
    }

    location @graphite {
        proxy_pass http://graphite;
    }
}

With Nginx, a proxy server is declared as an upstream server.
