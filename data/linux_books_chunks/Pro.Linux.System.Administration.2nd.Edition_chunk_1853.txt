The mirrorlist.txt file would simply contain the following:

mirrorlist=http://myrepo.org/mirrorlist.txt
http://myrepo1.org/centos/...
http://myrepo2.org/centos/...

With the fastestmirror plugin for YUM loaded, yum will find the fastest responding mirror from that 

list and use that when it runs.

There are other variables that can exist in your YUM repository configurations:

•	

•	

•	

•	

$arch–the architecture of your system (as detected by yum)

$basearch–the base architecture of your system (e.g., i686 becomes i386)

$uuid–a unique identifier that is generated for your system and stored in /var/lib/
yum/uuid

$infra–currently unused, but you may see it in your mirrorlist URL 
(&repo=os&infra=$infra).

When the variables are used as follows:

http://myrepo.org/centos/$releasever/$arch/myapp

That would be extrapolated to

http://myrepo.org/centos/7-2.1511/x64_86/myapp
