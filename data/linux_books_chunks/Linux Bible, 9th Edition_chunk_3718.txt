If it was a 
temporary mount (or listed as noauto in /etc/fstab), it isn’t remounted at boot time.

The command is umount, not unmount. This is easy to get wrong.

If you get the message device is busy when you try to unmount a ﬁ lesystem, it 
means the unmount failed because the ﬁ lesystem is being accessed.
