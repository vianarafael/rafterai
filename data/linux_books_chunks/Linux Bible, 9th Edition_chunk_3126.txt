The Allow directive can be used to permit access to matching hosts, and the 
Deny directive can be used to forbid it. Both of these options can occur more than once 
within a block and are handled based on the Order setting. Setting Order to Deny,Allow 
permits access to any host that is not listed in a Deny directive.
