One of those Linux systems will act as an NFS server while the other will be an 
NFS client.

To get the most from these exercises, I recommend that you don’t use a Linux server that 
has NFS already up and running. You can’t do all the exercises here without disrupting an 
NFS service that is already running and sharing resources.

See Appendix B for suggested solutions.
