This requirement modiﬁ es the require-
ment in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.

c)  You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who 

comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any 
applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, 
regardless of how they are packaged.
