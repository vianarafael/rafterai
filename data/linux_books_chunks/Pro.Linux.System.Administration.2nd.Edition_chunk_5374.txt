A Network-Based Service Definition

define service{
          use                               local-service   ; Name of service template to use
          host_name                    gateway.example.com
          service_description       Check SMTP
          check_command           check_smtp!25
          }

In Listing 18-20, we have a new service, called Check SMTP, that uses our local-service template and 
a check_command of check_smtp!25.
