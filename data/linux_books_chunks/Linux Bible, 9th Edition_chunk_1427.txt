Another 
reason to load a module is to identify that module as one that will be used by a particular 
piece of hardware that could not be autodetected.

Here is an example of the modprobe command being used to load the parport module, 
which provides the core functions to share parallel ports with multiple devices:

# modprobe parport

After parport is loaded, you can load the parport_pc module to deÔ¨Å ne the PC-style 
ports available through the interface.
