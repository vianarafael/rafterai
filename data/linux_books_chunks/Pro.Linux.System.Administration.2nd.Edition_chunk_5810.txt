In the 

vars.yml file, we will add the following:

backup_database_password: "{{ vault_backup_database_password }}"

Then in the vault.yml file, we will add our hashed MySQL password like this:

vault_backup_database_password: '*35D93ADBD68F80D63FF0D744BA55CF920B2A45BD'

The reason we do this is because once we encrypt this file, we will have no way of seeing the keys 
that we are using.
