First the smb.conf.full file with the explicitly set option workgroup to WORKGROUP.

[root@RHEL4b samba]# cat smb.conf.full 
[global]
workgroup = WORKGROUP

# This is a demo of a documented smb.conf
# These two lines are removed by testparm -s

server string = Public Test Server

[firstshare]
path = /srv/samba/public

Next, we execute testparm with the -s option, and redirect stdout to the real smb.conf file.

[root@RHEL4b samba]# testparm -s smb.conf.full > smb.conf
Load smb config files from smb.conf.full
Processing section "[firstshare]"
Loaded services file OK.

And below is the end result.
