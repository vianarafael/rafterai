four broadcasts

dhcp works with layer 2 broadcasts. A dhcp client that starts, will send a dhcp discover
on the network. All dhcp servers (that have a lease available) will respond with a dhcp
offer. The client will choose one of those offers and will send a dhcp request containing
the chosen offer.
