For a certain amount of money per year, you get binary 
code to run Linux (so you don’t have to compile it yourself), guaranteed support, 
tools for tracking the hardware and software on your computer, access to the com-
pany’s knowledge base, and other assets.

Although Red Hat’s Fedora project includes much of the same software and is also 
available in binary form, there are no guarantees associated with the software or 
future updates of that software.
