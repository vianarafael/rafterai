If you have multiple NICs, make sure the cable is plugged into the correct one. If 
you know the name of a network interface (eth0, p4p1, or other), to Ô¨Å nd which NIC is 
associated with the interface, type ethtool -p eth0 from the command line and look 
behind your computer to see which NIC is blinking (Ctrl+C stops the blinking).
