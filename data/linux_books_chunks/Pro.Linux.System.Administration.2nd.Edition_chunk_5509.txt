You can view the distributions install via this command:

$ sudo cobbler distro list
   CentOS7-x86_64
   Ubuntu-16.04-x86_64

The import will create two profiles as well; we can see them with this command:

$ sudo cobbler profile list
   CentOS7-x86_64
   Ubuntu-16.04-x86_64

After you’ve created your distribution and profile, you can see the full details in Cobbler using the 

report option, as shown in Listing 19-3.
