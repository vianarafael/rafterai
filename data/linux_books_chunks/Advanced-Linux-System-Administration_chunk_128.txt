Try passing init= option to kernel

Again we need to boot the system using a different method, then edit the bootloader's 
configuration file (telling the kernel to use another device as the root filesystem), and 
reboot.

In both scenarios above it isn't always necessary to use a rescue disk. In fact, it often is a 
case of booting with a properly configured kernel.
