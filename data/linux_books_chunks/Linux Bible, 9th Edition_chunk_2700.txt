The Upstart init daemon was created to operate in a ï¬‚ exible and ever-changing 
environment. 

With SysVinit, services are stopped and started based upon runlevels. The Upstart init 
daemon is not concerned with runlevels but with system events. Events are what determine 
when services are stopped and/or started.
