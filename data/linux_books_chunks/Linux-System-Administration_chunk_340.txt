Create a 400MB primary partition and two 300MB logical drives on a big disk.

Choose one of the disks you added (this example uses /dev/sdb)

fdisk /dev/sdb

inside fdisk : n p 1 +400m enter --- n e 2 enter enter --- n l +300m (twice)

6. Use df -h and fdisk -l to verify your work.

fdisk -l ; df -h

7. Compare the output again of fdisk and df.
