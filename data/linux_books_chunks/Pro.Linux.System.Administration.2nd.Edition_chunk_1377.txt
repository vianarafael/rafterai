You need to specify the device name, 

bond0 in our example, and give it the appropriate network information like its IP address, network, and 
netmask information. Again, we want this device to be initialized at boot-up.

There are some bonding-specific options listed in Listing 7-6, like BONDING_MASTER and BONDING_

OPTS.
