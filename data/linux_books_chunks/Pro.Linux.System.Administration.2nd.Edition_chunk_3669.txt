We are going to symlink that to /etc/krb5.conf.

$ sudo ln â€“sf /var/lib/samba/private/krb5.conf /etc/krb5.conf

Taking a look at that file, we can see that it looks like this:

[libdefaults]
    default_realm = SAMBA.EXAMPLE.COM
    dns_lookup_realm = false
    dns_lookup_kdc = true

The dns_lookup_ option determines whether we use DNS lookups for SRV records.
