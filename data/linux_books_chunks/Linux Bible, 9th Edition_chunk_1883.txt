Without the -u option, the default behavior is to automatically assign the next 
available number. Replace user_id with the ID number.

Let’s create an account for a new user. The user’s full name is Sara Green, and her login 
name is sara. To begin, become root user and type the following command:

# useradd -c "Sara Green" sara

Next, set the initial password for sara using the passwd command.
