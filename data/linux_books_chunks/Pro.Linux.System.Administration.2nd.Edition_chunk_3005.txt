We do that like we have 

previously shown you.

MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE example;
MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT CREATE, SELECT,  INSERT,  UPDATE,  DELETE  ON example.* ïƒŠ
  TO  `wpexample`@`localhost` IDENTIFIED BY 'secret';

What have we done there? We have granted only the necessary privileges to the database that 

WordPress should normally need.
