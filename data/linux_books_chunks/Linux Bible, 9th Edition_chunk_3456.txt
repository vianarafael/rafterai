Unlike the vsftpd (FTP) and httpd (web) servers that come with 
Linux, Samba has no default shared content directories (those just mentioned used 
/var/ftp and /var/www/html).

You can change a ﬁ le context permanently by creating a new ﬁ le context rule and then 
applying that rule to the ﬁ le or directory for which it is intended.
