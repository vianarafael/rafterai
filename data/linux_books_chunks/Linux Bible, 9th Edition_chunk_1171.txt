Parameter expansion in bash
As mentioned earlier, if you want the value of a variable, you precede it with a $ (for 
 example, $CITY). This is really just shorthand for the notation ${CITY}; curly braces 
are used when the value of the parameter needs to be placed next to other text without a 
space.
