Any resource 

you specify in the require metaparameter will be configured before this resource; hence, Puppet will process 
and configure the File['/etc/ssh/sshd_config'] resource before the Service['sshdaemon'] resource. 
This approach ensures that the appropriate configuration file is installed prior to starting the SSH daemon 
service.
