The ﬁ rst scan is a TCP Connect scan from the command line, using the 
loop back address, 127.0.0.1.

# nmap -sT 127.0.0.1
Starting Nmap 5.51 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2016-03-22 10:33 EDT
Nmap scan report for localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1)

Host is up (0.016s latency).

PORT    STATE SERVICE

631/tcp open  ipp

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.34 seconds

The TCP Connect nmap scan reports that two TCP ports are open and have services listening 
on the localhost (127.0.0.1) for requests to these ports:

 ■ Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is listening at TCP port 25.

 ■ Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is listening at TCP port 631.

The next nmap scan is an UDP scan on the Fedora system’s loopback address.

# nmap -sU 127.0.0.1

631/udp  open|filtered ipp

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.24 seconds

The UDP nmap scan reports that two UDP ports are open and have services listening on 
those ports:

 ■ Dynamic Host Control Protocol client (dhcpc) is listening at port 68.

 ■ Internet Printing Protocol (ipp) is listening at port 631.

Notice that port 631’s IPP is listed under both nmap’s TCP Connect scan and the UDP scan 
because the IPP protocol used both the TCP and the UDP protocol and thus is listed in 
both scans.

Using these two simple nmap scans, TCP Connect and UDP, on your loopback address, you 
can build a list of the network services offered by your Linux server.

Keep in mind that port numbers are associated with a particular protocol (TCP or UDP) and 
a particular network interface.
