Postfix doesn’t have SASL built in. It relies on integration with other applications to provide 
SASL capabilities. We’re going to use the Dovecot server to provide these SASL capabilities to Postfix.

If you’ve been following along with the example so far, you should have already installed Dovecot when 

we showed you how to install Postfix earlier in this chapter.
