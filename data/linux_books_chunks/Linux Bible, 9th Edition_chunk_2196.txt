For example:

# umount /mnt/test

This unmounts the device from the mount point /mnt/test. You can also unmount using 
this form:

# umount /dev/sdb1

In general, itâ€™s better to use the directory name (/mnt/test) because the umount 
 command will fail if the device is mounted in more than one location.
