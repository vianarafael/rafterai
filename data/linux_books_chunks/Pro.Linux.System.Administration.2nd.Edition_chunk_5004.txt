To increase the maximum number of open files to half a million, run sudo sysctl -w 
fs.file-max=500000.

 â–  Caution 
 Changing kernel variables in the proc filesystem can have not only a positive impact but also a 
large adverse impact on system performance. We recommend you do not change anything unless you have a 
good reason to. a good approach for tuning is measure, change, measure.
