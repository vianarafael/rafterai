To do this, we can use two main methods to leverage our newly acquired headers 
to move the e-mail to where we want it to go. These methods are

•	 Use a Local Mail Transfer Protocol (LTMP) agent like Dovecot

•	 Use MDAs like procmail or maildrop

•	 Use Mail client rules or filtering

Using Dovecot

We have seen Dovecot before for configuring our SMTP authentication.
