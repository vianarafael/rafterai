You can apply the patch with the 

 -b 

 option

By default this option keeps all the original files and appends a “.orig” to them.

patch -b -p0 < patch-file

The patch can be removed with the following lines:

for file in $(find linux-2.4.29 | grep orig) 

do 

FILENAME=$(echo $file | sed 's/\.orig//')

mv -f $file $FILENAME
