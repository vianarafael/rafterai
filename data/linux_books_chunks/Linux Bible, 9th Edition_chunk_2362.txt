Conﬁ guration of rsyslog is similar to the  conﬁ guration 
of its predecessor, syslog. However, rsyslog allows you to add modules to more 
 speciﬁ cally manage and direct log messages.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and recent Fedora releases, the rsyslog facility leverages 
messages that are gathered and stored in the systemd journal.
