You can define global configuration settings or service-specific settings under the 
[service] sections, such as [main], [master], [agent], or [user].

Configuring the Master

Typically the masterâ€™s /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf will look something like this:

[main]
certname = puppetmaster.example.com
server = puppet
environment = production
runinterval = 30m
strict_variables = true

[master]
dns_alt_names = puppetmaster,puppet,puppet.example.com

The [main] section contains the defaults for both the master and agents.
