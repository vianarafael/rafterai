The /etc/fstab entry 
looks like this:

# /dev/mapper/raid--volume-www
UUID=0814d564-b61c-407a-8483-9b176c684816  /var/www  xfs   defaults  0  0

After you create the /var/www directory you can mount it using the following:

$ sudo mount /var/www

Expanding a Logical Volume
Thus far, using LVM has seemed just a more convoluted way of using your disks, but what if your web site 
grew beyond 2 GiB? Without LVM, you would need to create a partition on an unused disk, and then copy all 
data across and make sure /etc/fstab was updated.
