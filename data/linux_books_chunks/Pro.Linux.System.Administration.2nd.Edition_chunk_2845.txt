However, Ubuntu and Debian 
differ in how they manage their virtual hosts, or site configurations. Most obviously you see that there are 
several environment variables declared in the configuration. The values that these resolve to can be found in 
the /etc/apache2/envvars file.

Also of note is the AccessFileName directive.
