The example that follows 
 demonstrates this ease.

# systemctl start cups.service
# systemctl status cups.service
cups.service - CUPS Printing Service
    Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/cups.service; enabled)
    Active: active (running) since Tue, 01 May 2018 04:43:5...
  Main PID: 17003 (cupsd)
    CGroup: name=systemd:/system/cups.service
           â””  17003 /usr/sbin/cupsd -f

After the cups daemon is started, using systemctl with the status option shows that the 
 service is active (running).
