We load the imuxsock module 

(module(load="imuxsock")), which is needed to deliver syslog system calls to rsyslog, and the imklog 
(module(load="imklog")), which allows for kernel logging. There are many modules that can be loaded, 
and you can find a list of those that are bundled with rsyslog in the man rsyslog.conf page.
