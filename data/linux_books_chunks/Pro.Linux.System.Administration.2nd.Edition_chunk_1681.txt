-A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited

The Netfilter likes the configuration of iptables rules in the following format:

* <table name>
<CHAIN> <POLICY> [<byte:counter>]
-A <CHAIN> <rule set>
COMMIT

The * filter is the start of the filter table stanza each line will be read in until the COMMIT statement.
