security context

The combination of identity, role and domain or type make up the selinux security context.
The id will show you your security context in the form identity:role:domain.

[paul@RHEL5 ~]$ id | cut -d' ' -f4
context=user_u:system_r:unconfined_t

The ls -Z command shows the security context for a file in the form identity:role:type.

[paul@RHEL5 ~]$ ls -Z test
-rw-rw-r--  paul paul user_u:object_r:user_home_t      test

The security context for processes visible in /proc defines both the type (of the file in /proc)
and the domain (of the running process).
