A Fact in a case Statement

node default {

  case $facts['os']['name'] {
        'CentOS', 'RedHat':     { include centos } # include the centos
        /^(Ubuntu|Debian)$/:  { include ubuntu } # include the ubuntu class
        default:                       { include common } # include the common class
    }
}

Here we created our default node definition, which is the node configuration used for all nodes that 
donâ€™t explicitly have a node defined.
