Whenever your system boots you will need to enter the password on the console as 
the system boots up. That means that unattended reboots are not possible and that you will need console 
access (physical or virtual) to enter it. One other problem is that the automation of installs is more difficult 
as the passphrase has to be passed at install time and that passphrase could be intercepted.
