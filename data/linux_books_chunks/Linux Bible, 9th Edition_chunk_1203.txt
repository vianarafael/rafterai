The until statement executes 
until the condition is trueâ€”in other words, while the condition is false.

Here is an example of a while loop that outputs the number 0123456789:

N=0
while [ $N -lt 10 ] ; do
   echo -n $N
   let N=$N+1
done

Another way to output the number 0123456789 is to use an until loop as follows:

N=0
until [ $N -eq 10 ] ; do
   echo -n $N
   let N=$N+1
done

Bash is great and has lots of built-in commands, but it usually needs some help to do 
anything really useful.
