You can download boxes from HashiCorp’s other 
service called Atlas or you can build your own. You can store, distribute, and publish boxes via Atlas too. 
Atlas has private and corporate offerings and integrations with other HashiCorp services.

 ■ Note 
 there is a bit involved in building your own Vagrant box, but it is an exercise you should try when you 
get more familiar with linux.
