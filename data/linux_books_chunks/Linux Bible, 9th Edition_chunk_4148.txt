Device ﬁ les should be stored in /dev and not in /home.

 ■ You can set the noexec option so no executable programs, which are stored in 

/home, can be run.

 ■ You can put the /tmp subdirectory, where temporary ﬁ les are located, on its own 

partition and use the same options settings as for /home:

 ■ nosuid

 ■ nodev

 ■ noexec

 ■ You can put the /usr subdirectory, where user programs and data are located, on 
its own partition and set the nodev option so no device ﬁ le located there is recog-
nized.
