With no options, du lists all directories below the current direc-
tory, along with the space consumed by each directory. At the end, du produces total disk 
space used within that directory structure.

The du command is a good way to check how much space is being used by a particular user 
(du /home/jake) or in a particular Ô¨Å lesystem partition (du /var).
