Ext4 
is intended as an all-round filesystem with excellent performance. It can support volumes up to 1 exbibyte 
and a max file size of 16 tebibtyes. It is the default choice for the Ubuntu 16.04 distribution.

Another option available to you for storing video, large images, or database files is the XFS filesystem.
