Configuring Dovecot auth

service auth {
...
  # Postfix smtp-auth
  unix_listener /var/spool/postfix/private/auth {
    mode = 0660
    user   = postfix
    group = postfix
  }
....
}

service auth consists of a series of directives enclosed in brackets ({ }). The service may be already 
partially configured in your existing 10-master.conf configuration file.
