After we have created this file and 
after each time we change it, we need to use the postmap command to re-create the indexes and restart 
Postfix to pick up the changes.

$ sudo postmap /etc/postfix/virtual
$ sudo systemctl reload postfix

Say we donâ€™t want to create Linux user accounts on our mail servers. We can still deliver mail for our 
mail users with virtual mailboxes.
