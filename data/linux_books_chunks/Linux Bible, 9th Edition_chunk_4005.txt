In this example, you can see that RAM is not 
exhausted from the Mem line (only 268492k of 3716196k is used) and that nothing is being 
swapped to disk from the Swap line (0k used).

However, adding up just these Ô¨Å rst six lines of output in the VIRT column, you would 
see that 4937MB of memory has been allocated for those applications, which exceeds the 
3629MB of total RAM (3716196k) that is available.
