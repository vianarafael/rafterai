Adding PTR Records for Our Hosts

IN      NS     ns.example.com.
1       PTR    mail.example.com
1       PTR    au-mel-ubuntu-1.example.com.
254     PTR    ns.example.com.

We save the reverse zone file and exit the editor. All thatâ€™s left to do now is add the zone definitions for 
these two zones to /etc/bind/named.conf.local.
