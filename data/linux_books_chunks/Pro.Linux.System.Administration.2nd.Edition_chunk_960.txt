You would issue the following:

$ sudo visudo â€“f /etc/sudoers.d/01_operators

In the above file we would place things that are particular to the operators group. Sudo will look through 

the /etc/sudoers.d/ directory and load any files it finds, in order, if present, as above.

The sudo command is complicated and, if improperly implemented, can open your host to security 
breaches.
