For Fedora and RHEL, the components you need that are not 
already in the kernel can be added by installing the nfs-utils package:

# yum install nfs-utils

Besides a few documents in the /usr/share/doc/nfs-utils* directory, most 
 documentation in the nfs-utils package includes man pages for its various components.
