Example:

# iptables -t filter -P OUTPUT DROP

 ■ -P chain target

Sets the overall policy for a particular chain. The rules in the chain are checked 
for matches. If no match occurs, then the chain’s listed target is used. Example:

# iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT

 ■ -A chain

Sets a rule, called an “appended rule,” which is an exception to the overall policy 
for the chain designated.
