The rm -r example removes the directory bigdir and all its contents (Ô¨Å les and 
multiple levels of subdirectories) but prompts you before each is removed. By adding the 
force option (-f), the hugedir directory and all its contents are immediately removed, 
without prompting.

When you override the -i option on the mv, cp, and rm commands, you risk removing some (or lots of) fi les by 
 mistake.
