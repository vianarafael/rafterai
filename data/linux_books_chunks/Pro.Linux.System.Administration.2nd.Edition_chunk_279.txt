As a 
bonus, along the way you will get familiar with some of the tools we use.

One combination of tools we use daily in our prototyping and testing is VirtualBox, Vagrant and Git (to 
track changes to our configurations as we trial and test). Being able to prototype full systems without having 
to pollute your local host or another server is a real benefit.
