We are going to call this storage.
example.com, and we need to create a series of A records to respond.

We need to be on our DNS server, and we are going to issue the following:

$ sudo nsupdate -k /etc/bind/ddns_update.key
> server localhost
> update add storage.example.com 360 A 192.168.0.240
> update add storage.example.com 360 A 192.168.0.241
> update add storage.example.com 360 A 192.168.0.242
> send
> quit

$ dig @localhost storage.example.com
