For example, we 

can see that in that directory the ppolicy.schema and ppolicy.ldif files for the ppolicy schema are present.

$ ls /etc/ldap/schema/pp*
/etc/ldap/schema/ppolicy.ldif  /etc/ldap/schema/ppolicy.schema

The ppolicy.ldif file has been derived from the ppolicy.schema file for us. We are going to add our 
ppolicy.ldif schema to our SLAPD. We do that by using the ldapadd command.
