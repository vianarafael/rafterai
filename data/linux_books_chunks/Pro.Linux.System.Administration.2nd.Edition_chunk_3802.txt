$ sudo gluster peer status
Number of Peers: 0

This is great. We have used the gluster command to query the Gluster cluster and check the status of 

our peers. We have not added any peers, so we expect this to be 0 at this stage.

You access and configure the GlusterFS service via the gluster command utility.
