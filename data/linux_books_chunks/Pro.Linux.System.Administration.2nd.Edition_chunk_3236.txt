In this case, we’re going to 

bind to all network interfaces, which is the default.

inet_interfaces = all

Or we could use the postconf command.

$ sudo postconf –e "inet_interfaces = all"

You can be more selective, though, and if you wanted to bind Postfix to listen only on a single interface, 

you could do so as follows:

inet_interfaces = enp0s3

 there is a setting called inet_protocols that controls which ip version postfix will attempt to use
