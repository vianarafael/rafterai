Apache soon replaced NCSA HTTPD as the most 
popular web server, a title it still holds today.

The Apache Group later formed the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) to promote the 
development of Apache and other free software. With the start of new projects at ASF, 
the Apache server became known as Apache HTTPD, although the two terms are still used 
interchangeably.
