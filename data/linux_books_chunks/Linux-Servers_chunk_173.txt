This screenshot shows an example.

root@debian7:~# cd /var/www/hunter2/ 
root@debian7:/var/www/hunter2# cat .htaccess 
AuthUserFile /var/www/.htpasswd
AuthName "Members only!"
AuthType Basic
require valid-user

Note that we are protecting the website on port 9000 that we created earlier.

And because we put the website for the Hackerspace named hunter2 in a subdirectory of the
default website, we will need to adjust the AllowOvveride parameter in /etc/apache2/sites-
available/default as this screenshot shows (with line numbers on Debian7, your may vary).

9         <Directory /var/www/>
10                 Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
11                 AllowOverride Authconfig
12                 Order allow,deny
13                 allow from all
14         </Directory

Now restart the apache2 server and test that it works!
