In the end, our hard working
dns server will find an answer and report this back to the client.

In the picture below, the clients asks for the ip address of linux-training.be. Our caching only
server will contact the root server, and be refered to the .be server. It will then contact the .be
server and be refered to one of the name servers of Openminds.
