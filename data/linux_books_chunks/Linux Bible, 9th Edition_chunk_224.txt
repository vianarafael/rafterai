As a project of the Free Software Foundation (FSF), 
GNU was intended to become a recoding of the entire UNIX operating system that could be 
freely distributed.

The GNU Project page (http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html) tells the 
story of how the project came about in Stallmanâ€™s own words.
