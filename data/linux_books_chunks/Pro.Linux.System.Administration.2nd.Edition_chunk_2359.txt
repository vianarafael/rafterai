So you will be 
able to extend and reduce ext family of filesystems using LvM but only extend XFS as you cannot reduce a XFS 
filesystem.

To specify the new total size, rather than adding 2G to the volume, you could also use the following:

$ sudo lvextend -s 4G  /dev/raid-volume/www
   Size of logical volume raid-volume/www changed from 2.00 GiB (512 extents) to 4.00 GiB 

(1024 extents).

  Logical volume www successfully resized.

In this case, both approaches produce the same result: a logical volume 4 GiB.
