This can take some time. Once done, Duply will restore the file. Here you can see that we have 
restored the bin/bash file successfully. To restore the whole backup, we use the duply restore <path_to_
restore_to> command.

Now that we have successfully backed up and restored files on our host, we will add a cron job to do this 

for us on a nightly basis.
