COPYING IN QUANTITY 

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, 
numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies 
in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-
Cover Texts on the back cover.
