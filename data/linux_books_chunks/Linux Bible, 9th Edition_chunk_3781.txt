In that case, going to the Setup screen, as described in 
the previous section, to either enable the device or change a setting to make it bootable, 
may be the thing to do.

If the device you want to boot from does appear in the boot order, typically you just have 
to move the arrow key to highlight the device you want and press Enter.
