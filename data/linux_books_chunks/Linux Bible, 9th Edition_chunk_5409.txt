Install the aide package, run the aide command to initialize the aide database, 
copy the database to the correct location, and run the aide command to check 
whether any important ﬁ les on your system have been modiﬁ ed.

# yum install aide
# aide -i
# cp /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz /var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz
# aide -C

To make the output more interesting, you could install the lemon package 
(described in an earlier exercise) before you run aide -i and modify it before run-
ning aide -C to see how a modiﬁ ed binary looks from aide.

To do the ﬁ rst few exercises, you must have the gnupg2 package installed.
