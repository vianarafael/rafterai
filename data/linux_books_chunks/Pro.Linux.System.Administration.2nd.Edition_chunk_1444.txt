You 
can ping a host or an interface to see if it responds. In the output response from issuing the ping command, 
you are shown the time it has taken for that response to come back. You can ping the other side of the world 
and receive a response in milliseconds. That is good. If you get response times in the order of whole seconds 
or a “host unreachable” message, that is bad.
