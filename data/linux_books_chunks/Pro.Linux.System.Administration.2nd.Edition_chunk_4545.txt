An object class declaration should follow this format:

objectclass ( <OID> NAME <name> DESC <description> SUP <parent class> <class type> 
<MUST|MAY> attritubutes )

750

The number you see, 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.344, is the private enterprise number (PEN), or object 
identifier (OID), which is a unique series of numbers for identifying objects; if you are familiar with things 
like SNMP, you should recognize this as they use the same OID concept.
