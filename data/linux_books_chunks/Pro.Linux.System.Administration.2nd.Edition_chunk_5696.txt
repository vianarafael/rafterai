The case statement, a concept common to many programming languages, specifies a result 
based on the value of a variableâ€”in this case we use the $facts['os']['name'] fact, which contains the 
name of the operating system running on the client (e.g., CentOS or Red Hat or Debian or Ubuntu).

 puppet has two other types of conditionals: selectors and if/else clauses.
