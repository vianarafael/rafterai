This incident will be reported.

A failed attempt to use the sudo command will be logged by your hostâ€™s syslog (or system logger) 
service, and then the message is sent to a file in the /var/log/ directory. On CentOS, you can see sudo 
command failures in the /var/log/secure file, and on Ubuntu they appear in the /var/log/auth.log file.
