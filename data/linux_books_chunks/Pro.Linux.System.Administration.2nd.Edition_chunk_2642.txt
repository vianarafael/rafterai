You will notice that the keys are owned by the root user. We will need to change the owner 
of the files to bind (Ubuntu). With the keys in place we will start up our bind server using the $ sudo 
systemctl start bind9 command or if your bind server is already running we can run $ sudo rndc 
reconfig.
