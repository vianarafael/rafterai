an easy way to check this is 
to see whether you can connect to an external Mta using a tool like swaks or if you can contact your iSp 
to find out if it restricts outgoing SMtp traffic.

if you are being blocked, you can overcome this with smarthosting. a smarthost is a relay server that 
receives and forwards your e-mail.
