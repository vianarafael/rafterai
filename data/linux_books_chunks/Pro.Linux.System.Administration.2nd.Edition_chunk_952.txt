This means all 
members of the defined group are able to execute whatever commands you authorize for them, in this case 
ALL commands on ALL hosts.

following line in the /etc/sudoers file on your CentOS host, then any users added to the wheel group will 
be able to use the sudo command to gain root privileges on your host.
