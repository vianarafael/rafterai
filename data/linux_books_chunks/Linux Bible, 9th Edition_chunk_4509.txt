The guard reviews the ID badge and access rules kept in a large manual.

 ■ If the access rules allow this particular ID badge inside the door, the subject 

may enter the room to access the object.

 ■ If the access rules do not allow this particular ID badge access to the object, 

then the guard refuses entry.

SELinux provides a combination of Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and either Type 
Enforcement (TE) or Multi-Level Security (MLS).
