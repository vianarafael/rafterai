they present some 
challenges, however. it should be very common knowledge that wireless networks can allow attackers to 
connect and sniff your network if inappropriately secured, and they donâ€™t perform as well as wired networks 
(those with physical cables). For example, it is still much faster to transfer large amounts of data over wired 
connections rather than over wireless connections.
