In our case, we do so on the remote gateway.
example.com host as follows:

gateway$ sudo useradd nagios

We also need to create the .ssh directory on the remote host and protect it.

gateway$ sudo mkdir /home/nagios/.ssh
gateway$ sudo chmod 0700 /home/nagios/.ssh

We can then copy the file, assuming jsmith has the appropriate access to the gateway server.

nagios$ scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub jsmith@gateway.example.com:/tmp/authorized_keys
nagios$ ssh jsmith@gateway.example.com
gateway$ sudo mv /tmp/authorized_keys /home/nagios/.ssh/authorized_keys && \
sudo chown nagios /home/nagios/.ssh/authorized_keys && \
sudo chmod 0644 /home/nagios/.ssh/authorized_keys

If this succeeds, we should now be able to SSH from the Nagios server to the gateway host without 
requiring a password.
