We can 

restrict access to this from only internal IP addresses.

<Directory /var/www/html/www.example.com/uploads>
    Options -Indexes -FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
    Require ip 192.168.0
</Directory>

The module mod_authz_host provides us with the facility to restrict access to parts of the site based on 
IP address.
