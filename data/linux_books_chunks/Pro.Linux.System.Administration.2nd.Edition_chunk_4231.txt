We have done this on all our three servers, and now we are 
ready to create our GlusterFS volume.

Chapter 14 â–  BaCkup and reCovery

$ sudo gluster volume create backups replica 3 \
  au-mel-dfs-1:/data/brick3_r1/backups \
  au-mel-dfs-2:/data/brick3_r1/backups \
  au-mel-dfs-3:/data/brick3_r1/backups

We now start the volume.

$ sudo gluster volume start backups

Our volume is now ready to be mounted, but first we need to make some changes to our Gluster 

configuration to allow the Bareos server to directly contact our glusterd daemons.
