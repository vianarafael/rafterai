They also allow us to demonstrate the major configuration options and styles, 
package management tools, and associated administrative techniques used by a broad swathe of the 
available Linux distributions.

Specifically, this book covers the material needed to implement applications and tools on

•	

Red Hat Enterprise Linux or a Red Hat–based distribution like CentOS or Fedora

•	 Ubuntu or other Debian-based distributions

When providing specific examples, we’ve chosen to demonstrate using CentOS 7 and Ubuntu LTS 

XenialXerus (16.04).

 ■ Note  LTS is an abbreviation for “long-term support.” The ubuntu project updates its server and desktop 
releases every six months.
