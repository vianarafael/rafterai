After you are in rescue mode, the 
portion of your ﬁ lesystem that is not damaged is mounted under the /mnt/sysimage 
directory. Type ls /mnt/sysimage to check that the ﬁ les and directories from the 
hard disk are there.

Right now, the root of the ﬁ lesystem (/) is from the ﬁ lesystem that comes on the rescue 
medium.
