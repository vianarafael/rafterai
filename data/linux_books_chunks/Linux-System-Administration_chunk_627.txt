bios

All Intel x86 computers will have a basic input/output system or bios to detect, identify
and initialize hardware. The bios then goes looking for a boot device. This can be a floppy,
hard disk, cdrom, network card or usb drive.

During the bios you can see a message on the screen telling you which key (often Del or
F2) to press to enter the bios setup.
