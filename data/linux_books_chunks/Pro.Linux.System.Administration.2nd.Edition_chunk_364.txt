You are now
ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.

The vagrant init command has simply placed a file inside your directory. This is the file that we use to 
configure our first Vagrant image.
