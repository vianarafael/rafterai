They have the following benefits:

•	

•

you can rename and remove subvolumes

you can easily and quickly snapshot subvolumes

you can mount snapshots

you can nest subvolumes

you can apply quotas to subvolumes

We are going to create a subvolume called mail and we will mount that.

$ sudo btrfs subvolume create /data2/mail
Create subvolume '/data2/mail'

We have now created a directory called /srv/mail and we are going to mount our mail subvolume 

there:

$ sudo mount -t btrfs -o subvol=mail /dev/sdc /srv/mail

We can now see that that filesystem is mounted.

$ df -h /srv/mail
Filesystem      Size  Used    Avail  Use%  Mounted on
/dev/sdb         16G   18M      14G    1%   /srv/mail

The great feature of BtrFS subvolumes is the speed of snapshotting.
