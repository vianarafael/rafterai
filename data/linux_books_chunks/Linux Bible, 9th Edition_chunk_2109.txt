With LVM, physical disk partitions are added to pools 
of space called volume groups. Logical volumes are assigned space from volume groups as 
needed. This gives you these abilities:

 ■ Add more space to a logical volume from the volume group while the volume is 

still in use.

 ■ Add more physical volumes to a volume group if the volume group begins to run out 

of space.
