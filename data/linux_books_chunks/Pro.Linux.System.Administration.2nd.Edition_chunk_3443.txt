On CentOS, we need to install the spamassassin package and tell it to start 
the SpamAssassin daemon automatically.

$ sudo yum install spamassassin

On Ubuntu, we need to install the spamassassin and spamc packages.

$ sudo aptitude install spamassassin

When SpamAssassin opens, it launches a daemon called spamd.
