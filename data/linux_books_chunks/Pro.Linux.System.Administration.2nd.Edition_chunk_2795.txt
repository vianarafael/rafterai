For instance, on au-mel-ubuntu-1 we could run the following:

$ scp jsmith@au-mel-centos-1:/tmp/data.txt ataylor@au-mel-centos-2:/tmp
data.txt                                      100% 3072KB    3.0MB/s    00:01

SSH also provides a replacement for the FTP. If you want to be able to interactively move files or 
directories, you can use the sftp command, as shown in Listing 10-38.
