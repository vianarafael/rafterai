By having device drivers 
(represented by ﬁ les in the ﬁ lesystem tree), UNIX could present an interface to 
applications in such a way that the programs didn’t have to know about the details 
of the underlying hardware. To later port UNIX to another system, developers had 
only to change the drivers.
