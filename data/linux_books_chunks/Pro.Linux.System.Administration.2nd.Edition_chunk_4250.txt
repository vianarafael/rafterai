We can change 

other defaults for the job as we require, like schedules or storage. Lastly we need to change the job for the 
database server.

Job {
  Name = headoffice.example.com
  Client = headoffice-fd
  Enabled = yes
  JobDefs = "DBLinux"
}

We need to reload or restart the Director service before this becomes active.
