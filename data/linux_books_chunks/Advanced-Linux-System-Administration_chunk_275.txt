As in the 
example below:

ps au|grep junk
root   13643  0.0  0.2  1724  600 pts/1   S    11:22   0:00 grep junk

Needless to say, there aren't any pre-installed tools called junk in general, so the above line 
would return a positive evaluation in a script!

There is a work around for this problem.

Use pgrep

This tool will search the output of ps for the PIDs of all processes that match the search 
criteria.
