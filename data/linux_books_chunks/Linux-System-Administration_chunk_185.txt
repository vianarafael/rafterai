Create a new directory and create six pipes in that directory.

2. Bounce a character between two pipes.

3. Use top and ps to display information (pid, ppid, priority, nice value, ...) about these two
cat processes.

4. Bounce another character between two other pipes, but this time start the commands nice.
Verify that all cat processes are battling for the cpu.
