Here are the Security settings:

# Security
anon_world_readable_only=YES
connect_from_port_20=YES
hide_ids=YES
pasv_min_port=50000
pasv_max_port=60000

Because the vsftpd daemon can read ﬁ les assigned to the ftp user and group, setting 
anon_world_readable_only=YES ensures that anonymous users can see ﬁ les where 
the read permission bit is turned on for other (------r--), but not write ﬁ les.
