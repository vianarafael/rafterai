We can use the postalias command to create and manage the index directory; however, the 
newaliases command manages this for us as we also need to reload the configuration into the daemon after 
every change and so is easier to use (and is compatible with the Sendmail program too).

We can use the postalias command to query the alias hash.

$ sudo postalias -c /etc/postfix/ -q root hash:/etc/aliases
ataylor

We tell Postfix which table to use via the alias_database configuration in the main.cf file.
