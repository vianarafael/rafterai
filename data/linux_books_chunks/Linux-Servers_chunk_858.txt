First we change a file:

paul@debian6~/project42$ git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
paul@debian6~/project42$ vi question.sh 

Then we verify the status and see that it is modified:

paul@debian6~/project42$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
# modified:   question.sh
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

Next we add it to the git repository.

paul@debian6~/project42$ git add question.sh
paul@debian6~/project42$ git commit -m "adding a she-bang to the main script"
[master 86b8347] adding a she-bang to the main script
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
paul@debian6~/project42$ git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
