To make it 
easier to have the term root stand out on each line, the --color option is added. By 
default, the matched term appears in red.

$ grep -ri --color root /etc/sysconfig/

To search the output of a command for a term, you can pipe the output to the grep 
 command. In this example, I know that IP addresses are listed on output lines from the ip 
command that include the string inet.
