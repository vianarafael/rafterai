To see the current access control lists, we need to 
execute the following:

$ sudo ldapsearch -H ldapi:/// -Y EXTERNAL -b "olcDatabase={1}mdb,cn=config" -LLL  -Q
dn: olcDatabase={1}mdb,cn=config
objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
objectClass: olcMdbConfig
olcDatabase: {1}mdb
olcDbDirectory: /var/lib/ldap
olcSuffix: dc=example,dc=com
olcAccess: {0}to attrs=userPassword by self write by anonymous auth by * none
olcAccess: {1}to attrs=shadowLastChange by self write by * read
olcAccess: {2}to * by * read
olcLastMod: TRUE
...

In the previous lines, you can see the access lists.
