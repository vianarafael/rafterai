You may already be familiar 
with the Microsoft Task Scheduler, which you can use to schedule tasks to be run once or repeated 
regularly on a given minute, hour, day, week, or month. The equivalent in Linux is called crontab (short for 
chronograph table). Its purpose is to submit tasks at set times according to the hostâ€™s clock. Tasks can be any 
script or application that you desire.
