Why is that? It is because Host 
F knows nothing of the 192.168.0.0/24 network. This host will send anything it doesnâ€™t know about to its 
default gateway. And because the default gateway of Host F isn't configured to know where to send packets 
to 192.168.0.50, it will send them off to its default gateway. Eventually these packets will die.
