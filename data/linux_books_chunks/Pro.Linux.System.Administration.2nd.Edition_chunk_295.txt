There are self-installing packages for Windows, Mac, Linux, and even 
Solaris (which is a Unix operating system for those who donâ€™t know). Simply go to www.virtualbox.org/
wiki/Downloads and choose the appropriate download for your operating system. You should be able to 
install VirtualBox easily.
