kernel

The goal of all this is to load an operating system, or rather the kernel of an operating system.
A typical bootloader like grub will copy a kernel from hard disk to memory, and will then
hand control of the computer to the kernel (execute the kernel).

Once the Linux kernel is loaded, the bootloader turns control over to it. From that moment
on, the kernel is in control of the system.
