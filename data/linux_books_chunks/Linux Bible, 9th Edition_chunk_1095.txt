Besides telling a process 
to end, a signal might tell a process to reread conﬁ guration ﬁ les, pause (stop), or continue 
after being paused, to name a few possibilities.

Signals are represented by both numbers and names. Signals that you might send most 
 commonly from a command include SIGKILL (9), SIGTERM (15), and SIGHUP (1).
