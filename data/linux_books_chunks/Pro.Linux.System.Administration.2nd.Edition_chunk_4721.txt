To get a perfect backup, you would want to stop the OpenLDAP directory server before you run the 

command in Listing 16-4; however, this is not always possible, and hot backups are preferable over no 
backups at all.

You use the slapcat command to dump the LDAP database to a file on disk using the Client Run 
Before Job script.
