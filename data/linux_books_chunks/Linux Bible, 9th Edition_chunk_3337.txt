This is one of the features discussed next, in the “Allowing 
uploading” section.

Allowing uploading
To allow any form of writing to the vsftpd server, you must have write_enable=YES 
set in the vsftpd.conf ﬁ le (which it is, by default). Because of that, if local accounts 
are enabled, users can log in and immediately begin uploading ﬁ les to their own home 
directories.
