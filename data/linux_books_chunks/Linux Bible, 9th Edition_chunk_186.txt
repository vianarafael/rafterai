This has been brewing since april, and is start-
ing to get ready. I’d like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as 
my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the ﬁ le-system (due to 
practical reasons, among other things)…Any suggestions are welcome, but I won’t 
promise I’ll implement them :-)
