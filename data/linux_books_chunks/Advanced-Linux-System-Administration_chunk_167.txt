Configuring automount

Mounting can be automated using a mechanism called automount or autofs. 

The /usr/sbin/automount is invoked with the rc-script /etc/init.d/autofs. 

service autofs start

This script reads the configuration file /etc/auto.master also called a map. The map file 
defines mount points to be monitored by individual automount daemons.
