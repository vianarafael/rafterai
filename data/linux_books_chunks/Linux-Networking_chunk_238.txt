sniffing ping

I started the sniffer and captured all packets while doing these three ping commands (there
is no need for root to do this):

root@debian7:~# ping -c2 ns1.paul.local
PING ns1.paul.local (10.104.33.30) 56(84) bytes of data.

In total more than 200 packets were sniffed from the network.
