We have created the “master” interface and we now have to add “slaves” to it.

We do this with the following commands:

$ sudo nmcli c add type team-slave con-name team0-port1 ifname enp0s8 master team0
Connection 'team0-port1' (4e2f4307-e026-4b1a-b19e-da8f1ad64d7a) successfully added.
$ sudo nmcli c add type team-slave con-name team0-port2 ifname enp0s9 master team0
Connection 'team0-port2' (ca1206ce-c0d3-45a5-b793-f10b8c680414) successfully added.

Again we have added a type of team-slave with a connection name of team-port{1,2} and attached these 

to interface enp0s{8,9} to master team0.
