A frame has a crc (cyclic redundancy check).
In the case of ethernet (802.3), each network card is identifiable by a unique 48-bit mac
address (media access control address).

On this layer we find devices like bridges and switches. A bridge is more intelligent than a
hub because a bridge can make decisions based on the mac address of computers.
