On Ubuntu, we can specify this by editing the /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server 
file and adding each interface on which we want the server to listen to the INTERFACES variable.

INTERFACES="enp0s3"

On CentOS, we do not need to set an interface on which to listen on. When dhcpd starts it will  

listen on any interface it can associate with a subnet declaration.
