We have created a directory called /data1 and we will mount 

it there.

$ mount /dev/sdc /data1

We can see that the filesystem is mounted.

$ df -h /data1
Filesystem      Size   Used    Avail   Use%    Mounted on
/dev/sdc         8.0G   60M    7.2G   1%         /data1

Btrfs comes with a utility to manage Btrfs filesystems.
