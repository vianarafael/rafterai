By adding the -a, you can also see the hidden Ô¨Å les in the directory (those beginning with 
a dot). The uname command shows the type of system you are running (Linux). When you 
add -a, you also can see the hostname, kernel release, and kernel version.

The date command has some special types of options. By itself, date simply prints the 
current day, date, and time as shown above.
