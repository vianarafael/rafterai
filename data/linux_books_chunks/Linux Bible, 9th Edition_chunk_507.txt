If you don’t like the applet’s location, right-click it, click Move, 
slide the mouse until the applet is where you want it (even to another panel), and click to 
set its location.

If you no longer want an applet to appear on the panel, right-click it, and click Remove 
From Panel. The icon representing the applet disappears.
