CentOS is a community-sponsored Linux distribution that is 
built from RHEL source code. Recently, Red Hat took over support of the CentOS project.

Iâ€™ve chosen to use Red Hat Enterprise Linux for many of the examples in this book because, 
if you want a career working on Linux systems, there is a huge demand for those who can 
administer RHEL systems.
