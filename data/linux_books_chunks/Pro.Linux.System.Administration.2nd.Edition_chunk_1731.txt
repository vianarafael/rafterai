Now to add our port forwarding, or what we called 

DNATs before, we are going to issue the following:

$ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=external --add-forward-port=port=80:proto=tcp:toport=80:toad
dr=192.168.0.1 --permanent

Our zone should now look like this:

$ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=external --list-all
external (active)
 interfaces: enp0s8
 sources:
 services: ssh
 ports:
 masquerade: yes
 forward-ports: port=80:proto=tcp:toport=80:toaddr=192.168.0.1
 icmp-blocks:
 rich rules:

286

We are now going to setup a DMZ zone for our services that live inside our network but that are 

accessed by external clients, such as public websites hosted on internal servers.
