the output of which is then converted into Systemd units.

the Sysv runlevels are also mapped to Systemd targets. Systemd will map each runlevel to an 
appropriate target, like runlevel 3 will be linked to the multiuser.target. here we show how Systemd 
maps runlevel 3 to the multiuser “target.” by using symlinks.

$ ls -la /usr/lib/systemd/system/runlevel3.target
