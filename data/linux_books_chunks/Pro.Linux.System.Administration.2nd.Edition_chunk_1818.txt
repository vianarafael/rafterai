For 
example, you could type yum search python | grep boto, and this will refine the list of the packages that are 
related to python by searching for the term “boto” and then displaying the resulting list of packages.

You can also use yum list see all the packages available from your repository, and you might also 
find yum groups list useful to see the groupings of packages (yum help groups will list the other possible 
subcommands for managing groups).
