Used alone 
on the command line, lprm removes all the user’s print jobs from the default printer. To 
remove jobs from a speciﬁ c printer, use the -P option, as follows:

16

$ lprm -P lp0

To remove all print jobs for the current user, type the following:

$ lprm -

The root user can remove all the print jobs for a speciﬁ c user by indicating that user on the 
lprm command line.
