We are going to create a new FileSet called 
Linux.

FileSet {
  Name = "Linux"
  Include {
    Options {
      Compression = GZIP
      Signature = SHA1
     }
     File = "/etc"
     File = "/var/lib" File = "/data" File = "/home"
     }
  Exclude {
    File = "/proc"
    File = "/sys"
    File = "/dev"
    File = “/run”
    File = “/tmp”
    File = "/data/backups/FileStorage"
  }
}

In this FileSet we first define the Name.
