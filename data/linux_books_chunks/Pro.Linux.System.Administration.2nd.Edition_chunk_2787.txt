If we do not specify an IP address for the forward starting point, it 
will be accessible only to local users, while it will be available to any users on the same network as the tunnel 
starting point if we specify an accessible address.

Since this requires quite a lot of typing, itâ€™s easier to define commonly used tunnels in the SSH client 
configuration file.
