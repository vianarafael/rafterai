Put them in the background and you 
can have several remote X applications running on your local desktop at once. For example:

$ ssh -X johndoe@10.140.67.23
johndoe@10.140.67.23's password: **********
$ system-config-network &
$ gedit &
$ exit

After you have Ô¨Å nished using the graphical applications, close them as you would normally.
