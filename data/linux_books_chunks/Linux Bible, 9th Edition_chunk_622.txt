For example, you run the date com-
mand from the /bin directory by typing

$ /bin/date

Of course, this can be inconvenient, especially if the command resides in a directory with a 
long pathname. The better way is to have commands stored in well-known directories and 
then add those directories to your shellâ€™s PATH environment variable.
