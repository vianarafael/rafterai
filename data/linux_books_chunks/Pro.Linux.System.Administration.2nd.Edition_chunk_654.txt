We start 
by looking for any letters (Latin only), capitalized or not, [A-Za-z...], or numbers, [...0-9], or a dot, 
[.] or dash, [...-].

[A-Za-z0-9._-]

These can appear one or more times [...]+.

[A-Za-z0-9._-]+

That is followed by the domain we are interested in:

[A-Za-z0-9._-]+@example.com

To improve our matching, let’s consider the following example text file:

email: root@example.com
email: jsmith@example.com
iam a sentence with somewordroot@example.comsomeotherword
email: bjuice@example.com

With the "[A-Za-z0-9._-]+@example.com" regular expression we would get a match on 
‘somewordroot@example.com’, which is not what we want.
