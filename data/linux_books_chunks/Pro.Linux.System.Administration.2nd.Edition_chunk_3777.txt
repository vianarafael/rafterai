FUSE is short for Filesystem in UserSpacE, which means that the NFS server doesn’t execute in the 
kernel but uses kernel modules to access necessary resources and executes in user space (see https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace).

NFS servers are not designed to be highly available without substantial modification.
