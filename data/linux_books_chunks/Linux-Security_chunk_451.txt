identity

The SELinux Identity of a user is distinct from the user ID. An identity is part of a security
context, and (via domains) determines what you can do. The screenshot shows user root
having identity user_u.

[root@rhel55 ~]# id -Z
user_u:system_r:unconfined_t

12.14. role

The selinux role defines the domains that can be used.
