The SHR column shows memory that could potentially be shared 
by other applications (such as libraries), and %MEM shows the percentage of total memory 
consumed by each application.

If you think that the system is reaching an out-of-memory state, here are a few things 
to look for:

 ■ The free space shown on the Mem line would be at or near zero.

 ■ The used space shown on the Swap line would be nonzero and would continue to 

grow.
