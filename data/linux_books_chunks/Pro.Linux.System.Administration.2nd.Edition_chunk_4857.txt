This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but if the system is “heavily swapping” (that is, 
moving memory pages in and out of swap space frequently, then because swap is much slower than RAM, it 
can lead to poor performance).

You can check whether this is the case via the vmstat utility. You normally want to tell this utility to print 

information every few seconds so you can spot any trends.
