In the following command, we will start configuration defined in /etc/openvpn/gateway.conf:

$ sudo systemctl start openvpn@gateway

You use the Systemd enable command to ensure it starts at bootup.

$ sudo systemctl enable openvpn@gateway

On Ubuntu, we just run the following:

$ sudo systemctl start openvpn

When we start OpenVPN, these configuration service files will be automatically loaded, and the server 

will attempt to start the specified VPNs.

Configuring OpenVPN
As we mentioned earlier, we need to configure OpenVPN on both ends of any connection.
