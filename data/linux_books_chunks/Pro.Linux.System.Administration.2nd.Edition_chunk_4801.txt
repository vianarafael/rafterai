The Apache request for username and password

You should now be able to access LAM, and you should see the successful login in the Apache logs.

...authorization result of Require ldap-group cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com...
...auth_ldap authenticate: accepting ataylor....
...authorization result of Require valid-user : granted...

This shows that the LDAP server is authenticating our request using the username ataylor and testing 

that this user is a member of the cn=admin,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com group.
