You can see in this sudo class we have defined a file 
resource type that specifies the basic security requirements of that file and a source file, or a file local to the 
Puppet master that we will send to the node when the agent checks in.

When the agent checks in, the Puppet master will search in the sudo module for a file in the modules/
sudo/files directory called sudo_web1; if it canâ€™t find that, it will look for sudo_Redhat (for CentOS hosts, 
sudo_Debian for Ubuntu), and if it cannot find a match, then it will provide the sudo_default file.

Depending on which client connected, they would get a file appropriate to them.
