Windows shrink down and separate on the desktop. Still holding 
Ctrl+Alt, use your arrow keys to highlight the window you want and release the 
keys to have that window come to the surface.

 ■ Tab through windows—Hold the Alt key, and press the Tab key. You see reduced 
versions of all your windows in a strip in the middle of your screen, with the 
 current window highlighted in the middle.
