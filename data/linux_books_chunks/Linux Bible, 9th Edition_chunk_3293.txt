If you have a ﬁ rewall in place on your Linux system, it is probably blocking 
access to all services on your system except for those that you have explicitly allowed.

If you decide that the default vsftpd conﬁ guration works for you as described in the 
 previous section, you can set to work allowing the appropriate access and providing 
 security for your vsftpd service.
