This process is sometimes called “ identiﬁ cation 
and authentication.” PAM is a centralized method of providing  authentication for the Linux 
system and applications.

Applications can be written to use PAM and are called “PAM-aware.” A PAM-aware  application 
does not have to be rewritten and recompiled to have its authentication  settings changed.
