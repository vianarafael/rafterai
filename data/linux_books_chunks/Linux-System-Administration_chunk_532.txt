The  next  example
creates a 200MB Logical Volume named MyLV in Volume Group vg42.

[root@RHEL5 ~]# lvcreate -L200M -nMyLV vg42
  Logical volume "MyLV" created
[root@RHEL5 ~]#

The next example does the same thing, but with different syntax.

[root@RHEL5 ~]# lvcreate --size 200M -n MyLV vg42
  Logical volume "MyLV" created
[root@RHEL5 ~]#

This example creates a Logical Volume that occupies 10 percent of the Volume Group.

[root@RHEL5 ~]# lvcreate -l 10%VG -n MyLV2 vg42
  Logical volume "MyLV2" created
[root@RHEL5 ~]#

This example creates a Logical Volume that occupies 30 percent of the remaining free space
in the Volume Group.

[root@RHEL5 ~]# lvcreate -l 30%FREE -n MyLV3 vg42
  Logical volume "MyLV3" created
[root@RHEL5 ~]#
