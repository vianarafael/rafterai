Read the documentation, then put the compressed file in a directory.
You can use the following to find out where the package wants to install.

tar tvzpf $downloadedFile.tgz

You unpack them like with tar xzf, it will create a directory called applicationName-1.2.3

tar xzf $applicationName.tgz

Replace the z with a j when the file ends in .tar.bz2.
