Here we are going to change the 
first 2 GiB partition from a Linux filesystem type to a Linux swap.

$ sudo gdisk /dev/sdb
Command (? for help): t
Partition number (1-3): 1
Current type is 'Linux filesystem'
Hex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = 8300): 8200
Changed type of partition to 'Linux swap'

Here we have used gdisk to manage our partition table and have issued the t option to change the 
partitionâ€™s type code.
