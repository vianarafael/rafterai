When you use some graphical tools to install package groups, 
you can uncheck default packages or check optional packages to change whether they are 
installed with the group.

If you decide you want to install a package group, use the groupinstall subcommand:

# yum groupinstall LXDE

This groupinstall resulted in 30 packages from the group being installed and 5 existing 
packages being updated.
