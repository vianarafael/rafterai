After you have made the symbolic link(s), test that your new or modiﬁ ed service 

works as expected before performing a server reboot.

# service My_New_Service start
Starting My_New_Service:       [  OK  ]
# service My_New_Service stop
Stopping My_New_Service:       [  OK  ]

After everything is in place, your new or modiﬁ ed service starts at every runlevel 
you have selected on your system.
