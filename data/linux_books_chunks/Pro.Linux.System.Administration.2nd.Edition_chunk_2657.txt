If we add more slaves, we can add them to the transfer-hosts acl.

When you’ve added the addresses for all slaves, save the file and then tell BIND to reload its 

configuration via sudo rndc reload.

 ■ Tip  to test the master configuration, you can use dig on the slave to simulate a zone transfer.
