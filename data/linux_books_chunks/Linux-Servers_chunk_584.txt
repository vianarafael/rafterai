winbindd

The  winbind  daemon  (winbindd)  is  only  started  to  handle  Microsoft  Windows  domain
membership.

Note that winbindd is started by the /etc/init.d/winbind script (two dd's for the daemon and
only one d for the script).

[root@RHEL52 ~]# /etc/init.d/winbind start
Starting Winbind services:                                 [  OK  ]
[root@RHEL52 ~]# ps -C winbindd
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
 5752 ?        00:00:00 winbindd
 5754 ?        00:00:00 winbindd

On  Debian  and  Ubuntu,  the  winbindd  daemon  is  installed  via  a  separate  package  called
winbind.
