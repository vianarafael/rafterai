Using com-
mands such as fdisk, you can view and change disk partitions. Filesystems can be added 
to  partitions using the mkfs command. Once created, ﬁ lesystems can be mounted and 
unmounted using the mount and umount commands, respectively.

Logical Volume Management (LVM) offers a more powerful and ﬂ exible way of managing 
disk partitions.
