These levels are called zones, and for each zone a domain is a part of, a 
query is done to find out what the name servers are for that zone. One of these servers is then queried in turn 
to obtain a DNS server for the next zone. The lowest-level zone—the one that all other zones are members 
of—is called the root zone. We indicate this zone with a single period.
