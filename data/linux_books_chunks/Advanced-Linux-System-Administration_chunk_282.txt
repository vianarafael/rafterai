If there are any differences the changed files are mailed to 
user root

#!/bin/bash
touch /tmp/md5old
touch /tmp/md5new
mv /tmp/md5new /tmp/md5old

for files in $(find /etc -type f ) 
do
        md5sum $files >> /tmp/md5new
done

x=$(diff /tmp/md5old /tmp/md5new)

if [ -z "$x" ]; then
        break
else
        echo $x |mail root
fi

Notice that the first time you run this script all the files will be seen as changed!

Checking valid MD5 fingerprints can be done from the STDIN or from a list of pre-computed 
sums using md5sum -c (--check).
