In this section, we will show you how to install a few web applications on their own virtual hosts. 
We will not show you how to use these web applications, as most come with excellent documentation and a 
support community.

We’ll start by creating a group called www to which we will add any users who need to be able to modify 

the web site installations, and we’ll add ourselves to that group.
