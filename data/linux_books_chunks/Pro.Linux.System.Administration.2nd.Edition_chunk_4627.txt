When working with dynamic access lists and 
ldapmodify, there are some rules to remember.

•

If you replace an index element, you need to load in the full access list.

You can append to the end of the access list only with an add directive.

The access list is read from first to last.

We can now put these access list directives into a file called access.ldif and then use ldapmodify to 

apply them.

$ sudo ldapmodify -H ldapi:/// -Y EXTERNAL  -f access.ldif

We will explain how to search test these shortly.

Working with the slapd Daemon
You can run your slapd daemon in two ways: with the slapd.d configuration engine (dynamic 
configuration) or without it.
