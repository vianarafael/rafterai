The example 
that follows shows the ﬁ rewall being disabled on Host-A for a Fedora 21 or RHEL 7 system 
(for other systems, you probably need to disable the iptables service):

# systemctl stop firewalld.service
# systemctl status firewalld.service

With a new service running and Host-A’s ﬁ rewall lowered, the nmap scans should ﬁ nd 
 something.
