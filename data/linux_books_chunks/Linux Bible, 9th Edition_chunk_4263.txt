A 
parent may take the plaintext word “candy” and turn it into cipher text by saying to the 
other parent “C-A-N-D-Y.” The other parent decrypts the word by using the same spelling 
cipher, and recognizes the word is “candy.” Unfortunately, it does not take children long to 
learn how to decrypt via the spelling cipher.

You may have noticed that hashing was not included in the preceding cryptography deﬁ ni-
tion list.
