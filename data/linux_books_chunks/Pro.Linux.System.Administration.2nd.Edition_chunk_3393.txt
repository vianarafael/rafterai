the smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter option specifies what types 
of authentication mechanisms are supported by the smarthost, and the smtp_sasl_security_options 
option disables anonymous mechanisms.

after your configuration is updated, you will need to reload or restart postfix, and you can then test to 
see whether your server can send SaSl-authenticated e-mail to the smarthost.
