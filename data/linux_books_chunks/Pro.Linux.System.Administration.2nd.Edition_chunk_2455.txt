By adding a selection 
of pool.ntp.org servers, you are assured of always having up-to-date and nearby servers available for 
synchronization.

 â–  Note  You can read more about the project and join the pool at www.pool.ntp.org/.

Using the host command, we are going to see what 0.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org will return as shown in 

Listing 10-3.
