All three components help to scale the 
Carbon service to enable the collection of thousands of metrics per second.

The carbon-cache is a required component and forms the basic collection model, carbon-cache, 
Whisper, and Graphite-API. It is able to listen on UDP or TCP ports (2003, 2004, 2007) and supports Python 
pickle and newline-delimited formats.
