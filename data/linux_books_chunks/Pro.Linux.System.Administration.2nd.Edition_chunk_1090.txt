There are some common targets in systemd 
like multiuser, reboot, and rescue. So much as in runlevels, we can have different targets that bring us up 
to certain and discrete states. For example, if we want the system to be in the state where everyone can 
log in and use services we would use the target multiuser. In that state, we would like sshd, logging, and 
networking to be available.
