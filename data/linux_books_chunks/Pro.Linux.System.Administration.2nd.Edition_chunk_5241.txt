The installation is simple once we have the APT repository configured provided by Elastic Co. (the one we 
configured in the installation of Logstash).

Not surprisingly, the installation is simply using the aptitude package manager:

$ sudo aptitude install â€“y elasticsearch

In our one server scenario, we do not need much extra configuration.
