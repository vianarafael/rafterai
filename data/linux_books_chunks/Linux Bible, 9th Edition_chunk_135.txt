I’ve come to that conclusion over more than a decade of teaching people to learn Linux. You 
can’t just read a book; you can’t just listen to a lecture. You need someone to guide you and 

you need to jump in and do it.

In 1999, Wiley published my Red Hat Linux Bible. The book’s huge success gave me the opportunity 
to become a full-time, independent Linux author.
