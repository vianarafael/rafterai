Creating a new database in MariaDB

In FigureÂ 11-6 you can see that we created a database called mydb, and then we switched to that 
database and checked whether it contained any tables. You will notice that when we switched to the mydb 
database our prompt also changed from [(none)] to [mydb] indicating the current database we are working 
on.
