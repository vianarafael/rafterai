We talked about header files and libraries 
at the start of this chapter and mentioned that you generally only need them when compiling software from 
source. In Listing 7-29, note that the script was unable to find the zlib headers. We are given the option to 
give the path where the zlib files are installed (--with-zlib=<path>), to compile without zlib (--without-
http_gzip_module).
