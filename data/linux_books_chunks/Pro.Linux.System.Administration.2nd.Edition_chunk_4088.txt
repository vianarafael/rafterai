We then would execute the following:

$ sudo ufw reload && sudo ufw allow bareos

Getting the Software
The Bareos download page (https://www.bareos.org/en/download.html) provides links to RPM and DEB 
packages of the latest releases for you to download. Distributions can be several versions behind the latest 
release, and only Ubuntu is currently shipping with Bareos.
