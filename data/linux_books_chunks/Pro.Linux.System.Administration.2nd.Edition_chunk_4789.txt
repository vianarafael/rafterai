This file 

requires the passwd, group, and shadow keywords to have these values:

passwd: files ldap
group:  files ldap
shadow: files ldap

As we have explained, these tell PAM what authentication databases to use and the order in which to use 
them. So when we are looking for information we would normally find in /etc/passwd, we would first use the 
files on the host and then use LDAP.
