It has the following contents:

include /etc/ldap/schema/exampleactive.schema

Now we can use that as the input file to our slaptest command.

$ sudo slaptest –f schema_load.conf –F ldif_converted

This creates an LDIF-formatted file.

 /etc/ldap/ldif_converted/cn\=config/cn\=schema/cn={0}exampleactive.ldif

If you get the following error:

58180fbb schema/exampleactive.schema: line 1 attributetype: Missing closing parenthesis 
before end of input

this indicates that there are whitespace errors in the schema file.
