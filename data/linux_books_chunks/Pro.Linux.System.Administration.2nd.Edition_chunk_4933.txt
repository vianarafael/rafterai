WHISPER_AUTOFLUSH set to True will cause Whisper 
to write synchronously, handled by the carbon-cache, and WHISPER_FALLOCATE_CREATE (Linux only) can 
speed up file creation (and therefore allow you to increase MAX_CREATES_PER_MINUTE).

Setting USE_FLOW_CONTROL to True (default) means that if MAX_CACHE_SIZE is reached, carbon-cache will 

stop accepting connections until the cache is below 95 percent.

Next we have a set of logging options.
