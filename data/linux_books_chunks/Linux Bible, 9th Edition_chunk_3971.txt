The following command line Ô¨Å lters out all lines except those associated with 
the httpd process:

# netstat -tupln | grep httpd
tcp    0  0 :::80        :::*         LISTEN      2567/httpd
tcp    0  0 :::443       :::*         LISTEN      2567/httpd

The previous example shows that the httpd process is listening on port 80 and 443 for all 
interfaces.
