The PAM conﬁ guration ﬁ le 
to edit is /etc/pam.d/system-auth.

Older Linux distributions may use the PAM module pam_tally instead of pam_tally2.

Again, you should make these changes to your local system-auth-local ﬁ le instead of 
system-auth-ac because authconfig overwrites your modiﬁ cations the next time it 
is run.
