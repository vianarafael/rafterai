If your RAM is full and you try to start another application without a swap 
area, that application will fail. 

With a swap area, Linux can temporarily swap out data from RAM to the swap area and then get 
it back when needed. You take a performance hit, but it is better than having processes fail.

To create a swap area from a partition or a Ô¨Å le, use the mkswap command.
