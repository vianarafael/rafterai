For example, the following command line concatenates (cat) 
ﬁ le1 and ﬁ le2, sorts (sort) the lines in those ﬁ les alphabetically, paginates the 
sorted text for printing (pr), and directs the output to the computer’s default 
printer (lpr):

$ cat file1 file2 | sort | pr | lpr

This method of directing input and output enabled developers to create their own 
specialized utilities that could be joined with existing utilities.
