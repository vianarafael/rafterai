Next we update the /etc/network/interfaces file with information about the bond0 interface.

debian5:~# tail -7 /etc/network/interfaces
iface bond0 inet static
 address 192.168.1.42
 netmask 255.255.255.0
 gateway 192.168.1.1
 slaves eth1 eth2
 bond-mode active-backup
 bond_primary eth1

On older version of Debian/Ubuntu you needed to modprobe bonding, but this is no longer
required.
