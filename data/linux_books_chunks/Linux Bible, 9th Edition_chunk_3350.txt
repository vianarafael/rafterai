Settings in the Ô¨Å rst 
section set the access rights for the server:

# Access rights
anonymous_enable=YES
local_enable=NO
write_enable=NO
anon_upload_enable=NO
anon_mkdir_write_enable=NO
anon_other_write_enable=NO

Turning on anonymous_enable (YES) and turning off local_enable (NO) ensures that 
no one can log in to the FTP server using a regular Linux user account.
