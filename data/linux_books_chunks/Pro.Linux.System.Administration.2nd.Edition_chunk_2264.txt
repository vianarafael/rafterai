What 
happens when we try one of the system directories like the /etc directory?

$ du -sh /etc
du: cannot read directory '/etc/ssl/private': Permission denied
du: cannot read directory '/etc/lvm/archive': Permission denied
du: cannot read directory '/etc/lvm/backup': Permission denied
du: cannot read directory '/etc/polkit-1/localauthority': Permission denied
7.0M    /etc

Because it scans the subdirectories in /etc, this command may encounter directories that you donâ€™t 
have permission to access.
