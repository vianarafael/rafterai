If you want to permanently change your umask value, add a umask command to the 
.bashrc ﬁ le in your home directory (near the end of that ﬁ le). The next time you open a 
shell, your umask is set to whatever value you chose.

Changing fi le ownership
As a regular user, you cannot change ownership of ﬁ les or directories to have them belong 
to another user.
