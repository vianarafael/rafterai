TLS_CACERT 

points to our CA certificate file, which will contain our example.com CA certificate. On some clients you 
may have installed the CA cert into the default location of /etc/ssl/certs. The demand we specify in the 
TLS_REQCERT field means that we will try to verify the certificate, and if it cannot be verified, we cancel the 
connection (this is the default).
