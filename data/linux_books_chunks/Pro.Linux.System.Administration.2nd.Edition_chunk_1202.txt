Description

Allows you to explicitly state the runlevels and startup sequence.

Allows you to explicitly state the sequence and runlevels you wish to stop the service.

The update-rc.d script will create start symlinks with the default start sequence 
(S20) into runlevels 2, 3, 4, and 5 and stop symlinks into runlevels 0, 1, 6 with the stop 
sequence (K80).

Removes the symlinks from each runlevel as long as the file /etc/init.d/script-name 
has already been removed.
