It cannot calculate the size of these directories, so the total that it reports is not 
correct in this case. To always get the correct total, you can run du as the root user:

$ sudo du -sh /etc
7.0M    /etc

And while we have the same amount shown in our result (7.0 M) this is due to rounding. If we used a –k 

(for KiB) instead of –h, we see values of 7,084 and 7,116 respectively.
