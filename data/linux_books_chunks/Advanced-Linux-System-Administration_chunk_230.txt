Shared Directories

We will define one share called 'readshare'  which is readable and another called 'rw-
share' which has read-write permissions but is only accessible for user 'tux':

The smb.conf options

[readshare]

comment = Read-only Directory

path = /usr/local/news/

guest only = yes

browseable = yes  # this is optional

[rw-share]

comment = Read-write Share for tux

path = /usr/local/documents

browseable = yes

guest ok = yes

writeable = yes

valid users = tux
