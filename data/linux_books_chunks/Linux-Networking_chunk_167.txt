lan

A lan  (Local Area Network) is a local network. This can be one room, or one floor, or even
one big building. We say lan as long as computers are close to each other. You can also
define a lan when all computers are ethernet connected.

A lan can contain multiple smaller lan's. The picture below shows three lan's that together
make up one lan.
