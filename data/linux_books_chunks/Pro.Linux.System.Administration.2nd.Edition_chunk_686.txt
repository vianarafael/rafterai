Weâ€™ve then told grep to search for the term accounts and used the > symbol to direct the 
output of this command into a file called matched_accounts.

another useful trick is the ability to run multiple commands on a single command line by separating 
each with a semicolon.

$ ./configure; make; make test

This command line would run the configure script in the current directory and then the make and the 
make test commands.
