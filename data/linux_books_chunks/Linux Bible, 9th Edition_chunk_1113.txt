(Remember that a regular user can’t reduce the nice value or ever set it to 
a negative  number.) Here’s how you would change the nice value for the updatedb 
command just run to –5:

# renice -n -5 20284

If you ran the top command again, you might notice that the updatedb command is now 
at or near the top of the list of processes consuming CPU time because you gave it priority 
to get more CPU attention.

Limiting Processes with cgroups
You can use a feature like “nice” to give a single process more or less access to CPU time.
