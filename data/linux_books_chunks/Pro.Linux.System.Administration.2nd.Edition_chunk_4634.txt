To do that, you would issue the following (on Ubuntu, use –u ldap 
and –g ldap for CentOS):

$ sudo slapd -F /etc/ldap/slapd.d -d -1 -u openldap -g openldap -h ldapi:///

You can manually start or stop an SLAPD server service using the following on either CentOS or Ubuntu:

$ sudo systemctl start slapd
$ sudo systemctl stop slapd

You can then check the status of the daemon with the following:

$ sudo systemctl status slapd

You can enable at boot with the following:

$ sudo systemctl enable slapd

Once the service is started, you can tail the journal logs to see any logging information.

$ sudo journalctl -xfe -u slapd

You can use the logs to monitor and solve problems with your access requests.

Securing SLAPD with TLS

Because LDAP can often contain sensitive data, it is a good precaution to make sure that the data transferred 
between your LDAP clients and your LDAP server is encrypted.
