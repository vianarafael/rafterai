Gives you a dry run of what would happen without changing anything.

When used with the remove option, forces the removal of the symlinks from the /etc/
rcn.d directories, even if /etc/init.d/script-name is still present.

The update-rc.d command will simply link init.d scripts into the /etc/rcN.d directories (where N is 

the runlevel), usually with the defaults of runlevels 2, 3, 4, 5 and a start priority of S20, and runlevels 0, 1, 6 
and a stop priority of K80.

From the command line, you can then issue update-rc.d to manipulate the services that run at 
particular runlevels.
