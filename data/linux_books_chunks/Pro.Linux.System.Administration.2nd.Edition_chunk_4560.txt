This is why we added the 
following in our db.ldif earlier:

olcDbIndex: exampleActive pres,eq

752

The exampleClient object class defines that we may have the exampleActive attribute present (as 
indicated by MAY) when we include that object class in our DN entry. If we wanted to enforce its presence, 
we can specify MUST instead.
