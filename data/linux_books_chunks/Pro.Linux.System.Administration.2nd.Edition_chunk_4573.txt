They begin with olcAccess and have been assigned an 

index number, {0}. We can view index {0} as follows:

(access) to attrs=userPassword
    by self write
    by anonymous auth
    by * none

This allows a user to write to their own userPassword attribute, and the anonymous user can 

authenticate.
