make  clean  will  remove  most
generated files, but keeps your kernel configuration. Running a make mrproper at this point
would destroy the .config file that you built with make menuconfig.

[root@RHEL52 linux-2.6.18.i686]# make clean

the Linux kernel

28.5.6. make bzImage

And then run make bzImage, sit back and relax while the kernel compiles.
