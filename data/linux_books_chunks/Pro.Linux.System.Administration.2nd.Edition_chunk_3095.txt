Because we are using the Let’s Encrypt staging server, we will be making useless 
certificates, but we will not be restricted to the access limits while testing that the production Let’s Encrypt 
systems have.

 We cannot use the example.com domain to create Let’s encrypt certificates as we obviously don’t 

 ■ Note 
own that domain.
