For the ﬁ rst 
example, here is what the share created in the system-config-samba demonstration 
 earlier in this chapter (called salesdata) looks like in the smb.conf ﬁ le:

19

[salesdata]
        comment = Sales data for current year
        path = /var/salesdata
        read only = no
;       browseable = yes
        valid users = chris

Before creating this share, the /var/salesdata directory was created, with chris 
assigned as the user and group, and the directory was set to be readable and writable by 
chris.
