The 
default signal is SIGTERM, which tries to terminate a process cleanly. To kill a  process 
immediately, you can use SIGKILL. The SIGHUP signal tells a process to reread its 
 conﬁ guration ﬁ les. SIGSTOP pauses a process, while SIGCONT continues a stopped process.

Different processes respond to different signals. Processes cannot block SIGKILL and 
SIGSTOP signals, however.
