In the example that follows, the status option is 
used along with the luks device name to determine further information.

# cryptsetup status luks-b099fbbe-0e56-425f-91a6-44f129db9f4b
/dev/mapper/luks-b099fbbe-0e56-425f-91a6-44f129db9f4b
 is active and is in use.
  type:    LUKS1

  keysize: 512 bits
  device:  /dev/sda3
  offset:  4096 sectors
  size:    493819904 sectors
  mode:    read/write
