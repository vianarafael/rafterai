If you choose the Minimal ISO your download will be 
quicker but you will have to download any extra packages (applications) from the Internet when you need 
them.

In this example we are installing CentOS from the following download link: http://isoredirect.

CentOS.org/CentOS/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1511.iso.

The VirtualBox application runs like any other application on desktop.
