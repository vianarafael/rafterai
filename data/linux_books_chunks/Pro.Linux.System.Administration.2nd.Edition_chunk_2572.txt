This in turn means that a client can continue querying other 
DNS servers, if this one cannot find information about a domain.

Finally, the listen-on-v6 option tells BIND that it should listen for queries on all available IPv6 

addresses on all network interfaces.

To avoid the chicken-and-egg problem, a caching DNS server ships with a built-in listing of root servers.
