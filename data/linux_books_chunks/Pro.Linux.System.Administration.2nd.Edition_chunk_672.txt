You can copy multiple files, using the asterisk symbol as follows:

$ cp /home/jsmith/* /home/jsmith/backup/

The target on the previous line, /home/jsmith/backup/, has to be a directory, and we’re copying all files 

in the /home/jsmith directory to this directory.

You can also select a subset of files.

$ cp -i /home/jsmith/*.c ./

On the previous line, we’ve copied all the files with a suffix of .c to the current directory (using the  

./ shortcut).
