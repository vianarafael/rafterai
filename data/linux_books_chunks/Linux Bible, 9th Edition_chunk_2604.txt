default      192.168.0.1 0.0.0.0         UG    0      0     0 eth0
192.168.0.0  *           255.255.255.0   U     1      0     0 eth0

The output from the route -n command shows that the default route (anything not 
destined for the local network 192.168.0 or the 192.168.99 network) is via the 192.168.0.1 
address.
