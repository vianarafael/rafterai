For example:

11

# mount | grep home
/dev/mapper/mybox-home on /home type ext4 (rw)
# tune2fs -l /dev/mapper/mybox-home | grep "mount options"
Default mount options:    user_xattr acl

First, I typed the mount command to see a list of all ﬁ lesystems that are currently mounted, 
limiting the output by grepping for the word home (because I was looking for the ﬁ lesystem 
mounted on /home).
