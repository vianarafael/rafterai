We could separate this section into a new file for just our people entries if we wanted.

dn: ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
objectclass: organizationalUnit
ou: people

You can see that the LDIF format requires the declaration of the DN, followed by the object classes 

we want to use and the attributes. Each declaration should be separated by a blank line.
