You can also choose to use an AWS Marketplace–bundled EC2 instance that 
allows you to pay an hourly price and removes some of the administrative burden to set it up.

It works in a client/server model, with a server running on your host and clients connecting to the 

server and creating VPN tunnels.

 ■ Note 

 other Linux-based VpN solutions are available, including ipsec implementations such as openswan.

OpenVPN runs on a variety of platforms including Linux, Solaris, macOS, and Microsoft Windows.
