Also, as noted earlier, groups are created 
automatically when a user account is created.

Group ID numbers from 0 through 999 are assigned to special administrative groups. For 
example, the root group is associated with GID 0. Regular groups begin at 1000 for Red 
Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora. On the Ô¨Å rst UNIX systems, GIDs went from 0 to 99.
