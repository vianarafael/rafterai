You will find an example configuration for your Apache web server and the configuration 
file, /etc/ldap-account-manager/config.cfg, containing the default username and password for your 
LAM installation.

$ sudo vi /etc/ldap-account-manager/config.cfg
# password to add/delete/rename configuration profiles
password: {SSHA}tj1yDeQfLJbmISXwh8JfjMb2ro3v5u44

# default profile, without ".conf"
default: lam

In the config.cfg file, you can see we have set our own password to {SSHA}

tj1yDeQfLJbmISXwh8JfjMb2ro3v5u44 (be careful with your ownership and permissions).
