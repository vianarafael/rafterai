Classiﬁ cation level is an attribute granted to an object, providing protection from subjects 
who have a security clearance attribute that is too low. You most likely have heard the 
classiﬁ cation level “Top Secret.” The ﬁ ctional book and movie character James Bond had a 
top-secret security clearance, which granted him access to top-secret classiﬁ ed informa-
tion.
