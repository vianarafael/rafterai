For example the system call bellow will allow any user to read  files with read access :

insecure.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl
$FILENAME=ARGV[0]   # this is the equivalent to $1 in bash
system(“/usr/bin/less”, $FILENAME);

If the script is set SUID root or if the -T option is used then the taint module will be called and 
this script will not execute.
