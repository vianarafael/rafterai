A cloud 
infrastructure may have dozens or hundreds of hypervisors running, possibly 
running thousands of virtual machines.

 ■ Virtual machines—The virtual machines you run on a Linux hypervisor can be 

the same type of Linux system, a different Linux system, a Windows system, or any 
other type of system that is compatible with the hardware on which the hypervi-
sor runs.
