The Backup job type performs a backup, the 
Restore type performs a restore, the Verify type compares the contents of the catalog to the file system you 
have just backed up, and the Admin type can be used to perform catalog maintenance, if required.

The Level of backup required is not really required, but it must be specified either here in the JobDefs 

or in the Schedule section.
