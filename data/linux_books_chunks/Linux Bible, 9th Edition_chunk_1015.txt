$ grep desktop /etc/services
desktop-dna 2763/tcp  # Desktop DNA
desktop-dna 2763/udp  # Desktop DNA

$ grep -i desktop /etc/services
sco-dtmgr   617/tcp   # SCO Desktop Administration Server
sco-dtmgr   617/udp   # SCO Desktop Administration Server
airsync     2175/tcp  # Microsoft Desktop AirSync Protocol

two lines.
