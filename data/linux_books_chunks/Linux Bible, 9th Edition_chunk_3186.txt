After that, I describe how to 
better conﬁ gure SSL communications by generating your own SSL keys and certiﬁ cates to 
use with the web server (running on a Fedora or RHEL system) conﬁ gured in this chapter.

Understanding how SSL is configured
If you have installed the mod_ssl package in Fedora or RHEL (which is done by default if 
you installed the Web Server group), a self-signed certiﬁ cate and private key are created 
when the package is installed.
