We’ll copy the ssh_limiter.sh file to /tmp, too.

Using jsmith, who has an account on the remote hosts with administrative sudo access, we do the 

following:

$ scp /tmp/remote_authorized_keys /tmp/ssh_limiter.sh 
 jsmith@branch1.example.com:~/

This securely copies the remote_authorized_keys file to the home directory of jsmith on the remote 

host.
