(optional, same as previous) Create a bookmark in firefox, then quit firefox on client and
server. Use ssh -X to run firefox on your display, but on your neighbour's computer. Do you
see your neighbour's bookmark ?

8. Use ssh-keygen to create a key pair without passphrase. Setup passwordless ssh between
you and your neighbour.
