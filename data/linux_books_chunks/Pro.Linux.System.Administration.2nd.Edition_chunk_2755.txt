You can change this by changing the Port and ListenAddress 
options in the configuration file.

The Port option takes a single parameter, which is the port number you want the server to listen on. To 

have the server listen on multiple ports, you can add extra Port directives, one for each port number.

This also applies to the ListenAddress directive.
