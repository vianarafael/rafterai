By default, 
if you run a yum command, yum checks for new metadata if the old metadata is more 
than 90 minutes old (or by however many minutes metadata_expire= is set to in 
the /etc/yum.conf Ô¨Å le).

If you suspect the metadata is obsolete but the expire time has not been reached, 
you can run yum clean metadata to remove all metadata, forcing new metadata 
to be uploaded with the next upload.
