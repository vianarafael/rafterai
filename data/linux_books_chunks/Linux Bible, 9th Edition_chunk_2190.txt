If the partitions on the disk did not automount, you could mount partitions 
from that disk manually. For example, to mount read-only a disk partition sdb1 that has 
an older ext3 Ô¨Å lesystem, you could type this:

# mkdir /mnt/temp
# mount -t ext3 -o ro /dev/sdb1 /mnt/tmp

Another reason to use the mount command is to remount a partition to change its mount 
options.
