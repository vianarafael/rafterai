If the load is 60, a problem exists.

This problem can be that the host is running a few processes that monopolize the CPU, not allowing 
other processes enough cycles. Weâ€™ll show you how to find these processes with the top utility a bit later. 
Alternatively, your host might be trying to run far more processes than it can cope with, again not leaving 
enough CPU cycles for any of them.
