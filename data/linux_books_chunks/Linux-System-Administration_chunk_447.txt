Every time chunks are written
to the array, one of the disks will receive a parity chunk. Unlike raid 4, the parity chunk
will alternate between all disks. The main advantage of this is that raid 5 will allow for full
data recovery in case of one hard disk failure.

10.2.6. raid 6

raid 6 is very similar to raid 5, but uses two parity chunks. raid 6 protects against two hard
disk failures.
