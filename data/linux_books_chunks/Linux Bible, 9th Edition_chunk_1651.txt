The line timeout=5 causes GRUB to pause for ﬁ ve 
seconds before booting the default partition. (That’s how much time you have to press 
e if you want to edit the boot line, or to press arrow keys to select a different operating 
 system to boot.)

The splashimage line looks in the ﬁ rst partition on the ﬁ rst disk (hd0,0) for the 
boot partition (in this case /dev/sda1).
