The File daemon communicates what files have been backed up to the Director 
daemon, and that information is written to the Bareos catalog.

The catalog records the files that have been backed up, the location from which they were backed up, 

when they were backed up, and onto what media (or volume) they were backed up. This catalog is kept in a 
SQL database for future reference.
