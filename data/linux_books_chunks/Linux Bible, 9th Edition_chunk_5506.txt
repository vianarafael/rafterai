Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute 
copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you 
must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure 
that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
