Available only 
on CentOS, the â€“r option lets you create a system group and will ensure the group is assigned a GID within 
the range for system groups.

When we try to create the ataylor user, we succeed because the prerequisite groups now exist.

$ sudo useradd -m -c 'Anne Taylor' -G printing,finance ataylor

We can also add existing users to groups using the usermod command.

$ sudo usermod -a -G accounts ataylor

The usermod command is used to modify existing users.
