More on the last option when we talk about 
DHCP in Chapter 10.

Our branch offices each have a separate network address, and they range from 192.168.10.0/24 to 
192.168.30.0/24. This gives us 254 possible nodes (or devices) in each branch office, with the ability to 
expand them if required.

IP ADDRESSING AND SUBNETTING

in the foregoing example we looked at an iPv4 network like 192.168.10.0/24.
