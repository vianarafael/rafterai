insmod /lib/lvm-mod.o

raidautorun /dev/md1

The volume group is then activated with vgscan from the rc.sysinit script.

As with software RAID we are going to investigate some issues we need to consider when 
using LVM on the root device.

First make sure the volume we have created previously is mounted.
