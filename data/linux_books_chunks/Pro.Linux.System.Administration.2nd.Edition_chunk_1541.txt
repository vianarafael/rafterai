You will see how useful this is shortly in the “Mtr” section.

So how do we fix this? Well, we add a route to Host F telling it how to send packets to Host D via Host E.

$ sudo /sbin/ip route add 192.168.0.0/24 via 192.168.10.2 dev enp0s8

Now when Host F tries to ping Host D, we get the following result:

$ ping 192.168.0.50
PING 192.168.0.50 (192.168.0.50) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.0.50: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.24 ms

262

After adding the route to Host F, we can now reach Host D.
