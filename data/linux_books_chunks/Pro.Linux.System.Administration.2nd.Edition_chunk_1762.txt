Most Linux 
distributions come with a package manager, which usually has a set of command-line and graphical tools for 
managing packages, and a small database that records what has been installed.

By the end of this chapter, youâ€™ll have a good understanding of what packages are, how to install 
and remove them, how to find the right package for your needs, and how to install software from source 
code.
