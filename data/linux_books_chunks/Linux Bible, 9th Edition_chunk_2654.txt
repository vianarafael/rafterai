The initialization daemon can be thought of as the “mother of all processes.” 
This daemon is the ﬁ rst process to be started by the kernel on the Linux server. For Linux 
 distributions that use SysvInit or Upstart, the init daemon is literally named init. For 
systemd, the init daemon is named systemd.

The Linux kernel has a process ID (PID) of 0.
