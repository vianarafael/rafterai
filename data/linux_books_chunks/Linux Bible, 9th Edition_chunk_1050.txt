Likewise, logging into a Linux desktop causes many background 
 processes to kick off, such as processes for managing audio, desktop panels, authentication, 
and other desktop features.

To page through all the processes running on your Linux system for the current user, add 
the pipe (|) and the less command to ps ux:

$ ps ux | less

To page through all processes running for all users on your system, use the ps aux 
 command as follows:

$ ps aux | less

A pipe (located above the backslash character on the keyboard) enables you to direct the 
output of one command to be the input of the next command.
