The cd command can be used 
with no options (to take you to your home directory) or with full or relative paths. Consider 
the following commands:

$ cd /usr/share/
$ pwd
/usr/share
$ cd doc
/usr/share/doc
$ cd
$ pwd
/home/chris

The /usr/share option represents the absolute path to a directory on the system.
