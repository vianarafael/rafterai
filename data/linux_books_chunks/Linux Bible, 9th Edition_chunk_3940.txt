Systems connected to the 
Internet do name-to-address resolution by communicating to a domain name system (DNS) 
server that can provide them with the IP addresses of the requested hosts.

The DNS server your system uses can be entered manually or picked up automatically from 
a DHCP server when you start your network interfaces.
