the /etc/postfix/smtp_sasl_passwd file 
needs to contain the name of the smarthost and the username and password (separated by a colon) 
required to authenticate like so:

mail.isp.net        username:password

558

You need to make sure these files are readable only by the root user and have appropriate permissions 
to stop anyone viewing your passwords.

$ sudo chown root:root /etc/postfix/smtp_sasl_passwd
$ sudo chmod 0600 /etc/postfix/smtp_sasl_passwd

We then use the postmap command to create a database.

$ sudo postmap hash:/etc/postfix/smtp_sasl_passwd

a file called smtp_sasl_passwd.db is then created.

the remaining options are pretty simple.
