ping –c <count> –i <interval> –I <interface address> –s <packet size> destination

The ping command will send pings to a host indefinitely unless you either stop it, using Ctrl+C usually, 

or give it the number of pings to attempt using the –c number option.

You can also express the interval between pings as –i number (in seconds) and choose the interface you 

wish to use as the source address, specified by -I IP address or the interface name like: -I enp0s8.
