To change the default, you can specify something like this:

Listen 192.168.0.1:8080

The previous line specifies to listen only to a specific IPv4 address and on the port 8080. Be careful, 
because multiple Listen directives with the same IP and port will give an error ((98)Address already in 
use) when Apache tries to start.
