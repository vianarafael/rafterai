If a disk fails, the 
checksum can then be used in combination with the data on the remaining disks to recalculate the missing 
parts of the data. The faster your CPU, the faster this process is.

FigureÂ 9-2 shows a simple diagram illustrating how data and checksum are split between disks. B1, B2, 

and B3 are parts of file B. Bp is a checksum, or parity.
