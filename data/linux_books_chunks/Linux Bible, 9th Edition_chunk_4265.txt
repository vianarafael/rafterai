However, unlike 
encryption, after you create a hash, you cannot de-hash it back to its original plaintext.

In order for a hashing algorithm to be used in computer security, it needs to be  collision-free, 
which means that the hashing algorithm does not output the same hash for two totally 
 different inputs. Each input must have a unique hashed output.
