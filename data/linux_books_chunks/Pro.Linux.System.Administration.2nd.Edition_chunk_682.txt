piping passes the output of a command to 
another command, for example

$ cat /etc/passwd | grep ataylor

In the previous line weâ€™ve outputted the contents of the /etc/passwd file and then piped the result to 
the grep command to search for the term ataylor. This would output any line or lines containing the 
term ataylor.
