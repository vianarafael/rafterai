What the output from this command shows is that our first hop (each host/router we pass through is called 
a hop) is our firewall router. Next is the default gateway of our Internet connection at our ISP. As we pass 
through each hop along the way, we record information about our route. At the penultimate hop, we reach 
the IBM gateway.
