Define 

the filter like so:

spamassassin     unix     -     n     n     -     -     pipe ïƒ‰
 user=spamd argv=/usr/bin/spamc -e /usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -f ${sender} ${recipient}

This creates a new service in the master.cf file, of the type unix, which is a Unix socket, and it calls 

another Postfix daemon called pipe, which delivers e-mail to an external command.
