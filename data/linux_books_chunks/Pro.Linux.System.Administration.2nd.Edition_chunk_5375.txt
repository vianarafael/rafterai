This passes the value 25 to a command called check_smtp. Letâ€™s look at 
that command now:

define command{
         command_name    check_smtp
         command_line    $USER1$/check_smtp -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -p $ARG1$
         }

Here we have a command that runs a plug-in called check_smtp. It accepts the $HOSTADDRESS$ macro, 
which is the IP address of the SMTP server we want to check.
