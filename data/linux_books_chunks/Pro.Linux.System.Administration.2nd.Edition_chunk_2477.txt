We also provided an IP (Internet Protocol) 
address for the host. We can, of course, use the IP address to access our host; however, humans tend to 
like to use names more than than “strange” numbers. But how do we map the hostname to the IP address? 
We can use local host’s files to do address-to-name mappings, as we showed you in Chapter 4.
