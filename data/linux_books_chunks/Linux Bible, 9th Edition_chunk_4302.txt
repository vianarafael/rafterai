In the example code that follows, note the following:

 ■ jill has created a text ﬁ le, MessageForJohn.txt, for user johndoe.

 ■ She encrypts the ﬁ le using his public key.

 ■ The encrypted ﬁ le, MessageForJohn, is created by the --out option.

 ■ The option --recipient identiﬁ es johndoe’s public key using only the real name 

portion of his public key’s UID in quotation marks, "John Doe".

$ gpg2 --out MessageForJohn --recipient "John Doe" \
 --encrypt MessageForJohn.txt
...
$ ls
JohnDoe.pub  MessageForJohn  MessageForJohn.txt

The encrypted message ﬁ le, MessageForJohn, created from the plaintext ﬁ le, 
MessageForJohn.txt, can be securely sent to the user johndoe.
