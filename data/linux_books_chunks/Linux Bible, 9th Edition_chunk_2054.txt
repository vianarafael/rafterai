If you happen to have a system 
that uses GUID partition tables, you can use a tool called gdisk instead of the fdisk 
 command described in this chapter.

Limitations imposed by the MBR speciÔ¨Å cation brought about the need for GUID  partitions. 
In particular, MBR partitions are limited to 2TB in size. GUID partitions can create 
 partitions up to 9.4ZB (zettabytes).
