Windows, DOS, OS/2, Mac 
OS/X, and other client systems can access Samba servers to share ﬁ les and printers in the same 
ways they would from Windows ﬁ le and print servers.

With Samba, you can use standard TCP/IP networking to communicate with clients. For name 
 service, Samba supports regular TCP/IP hostnames, as well as NetBIOS names.
