The acl option allows for posix acl’s to be used, which 
again can be used for fine-grained directory access (see man acl for details).

There are many more mount options that define things like access to files and directories on filesystems, 
that might tweak performance, and options for filesystems that don’t support Unix-style file permissions, like 
FAT32 and NTFS.
