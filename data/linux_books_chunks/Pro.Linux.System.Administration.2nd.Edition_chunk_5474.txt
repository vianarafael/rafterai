SELinux by default will prevent this, so we need to issue the 
following:

$ sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect true

Cobbler has some specific SELinux settings, and you can view them with the following command:

$ sudo getsebool -a|grep cobbler
cobbler_anon_write --> off
cobbler_can_network_connect --> off
cobbler_use_cifs --> off
cobbler_use_nfs --> off
httpd_can_network_connect_cobbler --> off
httpd_serve_cobbler_files --> off

We will enable the following SELinux Booleans:

$ sudo setsebool -P httpd_serve_cobbler_files on
$ sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_cobbler  on
