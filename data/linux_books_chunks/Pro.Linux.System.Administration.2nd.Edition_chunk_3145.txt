On CentOS, we should create the startup links via 

systemctl first.

$ sudo systemctl enable squid

We can now start Squid via sudo systemctl start squid on CentOS or restart it on Ubuntu via sudo 

service squid restart. On CentOS, the cache directory we specified will be created when Squid first 
starts.
