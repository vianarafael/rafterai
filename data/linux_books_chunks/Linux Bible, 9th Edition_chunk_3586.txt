Chapter 20: Confi guring an NFS File Server

# service rcpbind start
Starting rpcbind:                    [  OK  ]
# service nfs start
Starting NFS services:               [  OK  ]
Starting NFS quotas:                 [  OK  ]
Starting NFS daemon:                 [  OK  ]
Starting NFS mountd:                 [  OK  ]
# chkconfig rpcbind on
# chkconfig nfs on

After the service is running, the commands (mount, exportfs, and so on) and ﬁ les 
(/etc/exports, /etc/fstab, and so on) for actually conﬁ guring NFS are basically the 
same on every Linux system.
