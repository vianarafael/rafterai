Be sure that the fi le remains readable only by root.

The following is an example of the SMB URI you could add to the SMB:// box:

jjones:my9passswd@FSTREET/NS1/hp

The URI shown here identiﬁ es the username (jjones), the user’s password (my9passswd), 
the workgroup (FSTREET), the server (NS1), and the printer queue name (hp).

Complete the rest of the procedure as you would for a local printer (see the section “Adding 
a local printer” earlier in this chapter).

If everything is set up properly, you can use the standard lpr command to print the ﬁ le to 
the printer.
