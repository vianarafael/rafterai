To do this, you 

use the ls, or list directory, command, as you can see in Listing 4-7.

Listing 4-7.  Listing the Contents of a Directory

$ ls
bin dev etc lib lost+found mnt proc root sys usr
boot home  lib64  media opt sbin srv tmp var

In Listing 4-7, you can see the ls command has returned a list of files and directories that are in the root 

directory.
