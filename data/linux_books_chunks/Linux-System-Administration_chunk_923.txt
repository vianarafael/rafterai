compiling software

First  and  most  important,  whenever  you  download  source  code  for  installation,  start  by
reading the README file!

Usually the steps are always the same three : running ./configure followed by make (which
is the actual compiling) and then by make install to copy the files to their proper location.

./configure
make
make install
