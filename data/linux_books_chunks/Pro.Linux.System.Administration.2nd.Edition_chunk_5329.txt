A host can be in the UP, DOWN, or UNREACHABLE state, and a 

service can be in the UP, WARNING, CRITICAL, or UNKNOWN state.

 the UNREACHABLE status is used when dependencies and parent-child relationships have been 

 â–  Note 
configured and a host is not available because a parent or host it depends on is not available.

The plug-ins themselves, though, return only the WARNING, CRITICAL, and UNKNOWN states (the UNKNOWN 

state is generally set when a plug-in fails to run or an error is returned rather than a valid status).
