Also, remember that 
NetworkManager is going to manage these interfaces so we will begin using some of the nmcli commands to 
show our connections but you can also use the ip command we saw earlier.

When we make changes to our interface scripts, like ifcfg-enp0s8, we need to tell NetworkManager to 
reread it.
