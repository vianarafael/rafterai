directories, but the preferred method is to use an option on the systemctl command as 
follows:

# systemctl list-unit-files --type=service
UNIT FILE                                   STATE
...
cups.service                                enabled
...
dbus.service                                static
...
NetworkManager.service                      enabled
...
poweroff.service                            static
...
sshd.service                                enabled
sssd.service                                disabled
