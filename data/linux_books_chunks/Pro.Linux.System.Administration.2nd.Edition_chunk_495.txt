The 
whatis command searches a summary database of commands that is available on most Linux distributions 
for a complete word match as follows:

$ whatis useradd
useradd(8) – create a new user or update default new user information

The whatis search has returned the useradd command and included a brief description of what the 

command does.

The apropos command also searches the whatis database but searches for strings rather than complete 

words.

$ apropos whoam
ldapwhoami(1) – LDAP who am i? tool
whoami(1) – print effective userid

The apropos search has searched the whatis database for all references to the string whoami and 

returned a number of commands and functions that contain this string.

There are also some additional useful commands that can tell you about commands on your host.
