However, when you start using third-party repositories, those repositories may 
have dependencies on repositories that they can’t control. For example, if a reposi-
tory creates a new version of its own software that requires later versions of basic 
software (such as libraries), the versions they need might not be available from the 
Fedora repository.

 ■ Consistently update your system.
