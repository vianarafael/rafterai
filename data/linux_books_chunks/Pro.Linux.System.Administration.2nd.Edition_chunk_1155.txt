multi-user.target

So when you issue the telinit 3 command the following target is run by Systemd.

[Unit]
Description=Multi-User System
Documentation=man:systemd.special(7)
Requires=basic.target
Conflicts=rescue.service rescue.target
After=basic.target rescue.service rescue.target
AllowIsolate=yes

to the applications and packages that are not “Systemd ready,” there is no difference as long as they 
have a LSB-compliant init.d script.

the original Sysv init actually hasn’t been used on operating systems for quite some time and upstart 
was swapped in to manage Sysv in both red hat- and debian-based systems.

In Chapter 4, we introduced you to the concept of processes and services.
