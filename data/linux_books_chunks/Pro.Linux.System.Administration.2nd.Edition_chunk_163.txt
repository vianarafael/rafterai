Most people don’t think about 
a globalized world when they start designing their services. Your systems might start off in your local 
time zone but as you grow you might find your systems are in completely different time zones. This can 
lead to problems when you read a timestamp and wonder, “Yeah, but is that 4 am their time, our time  
or UTC?”

You can still get localized time information.
