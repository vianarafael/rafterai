For example, in Listing 5-14 
you can see that all four management groups specify the pam_unix.so module.

auth        sufficient    pam_unix.so nullok try_first_pass
account     required      pam_unix.so
password    sufficient    pam_unix.so m5 shadow nullok try_first_pass use_authtok
session     required      pam_unix.so

This indicates that the pam_unix.so module, which is the module that takes care of most standard Unix 
authentication functions such as entering a traditional password, can perform checks and functions for each 
management group.
