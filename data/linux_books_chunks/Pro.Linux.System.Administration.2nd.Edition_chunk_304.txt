Use the slider or type in the amount of memory you need for your 
system.

 ■ Note 
 It is important to note that you can “overcommit” your memory (i.e., allocate more than your host 
system has available to it to a number of virtual machines)—meaning if my host system has 8gB raM, we 
can have one virtual machine of 2gB, one of 4gB, and one of 6gB and they would all be able to run fine at the 
same time.
