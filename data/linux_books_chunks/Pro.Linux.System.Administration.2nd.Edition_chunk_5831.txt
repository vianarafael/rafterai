Serverspec Testing
We can now automate the building of our hosts, but how do we know if we make a change to one of our 
tasks that it doesn’t unintentionally break some other important configuration? If we have some basic 
compliance requirements, how do we know that we are still meeting those obligations with each new build? 
Well, just like normal code, we can write tests that give us assurance that the hosts we build meet the defined 
requirements specified in our tests.
