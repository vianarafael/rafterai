To try out any of those 
examples, however, you can simply type them into a shell, as shown in the previous example.

In the following example, MYFILENAME is set to /home/digby/myfile.txt. Next, the 
FILE variable is set to myfile.txt and DIR is set to /home/digby. In the NAME  variable, 
the ﬁ lename is cut down to simply myfile; then, in the EXTENSION variable, the ﬁ le 
extension is set to txt.
