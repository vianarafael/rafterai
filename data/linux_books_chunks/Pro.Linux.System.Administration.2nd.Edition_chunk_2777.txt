It is also quite common for people to use the ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p 
jumphost instead of the nc command.

With this we can now issue a ssh private.foo.com command and ssh will connect to the jumphost 

and then establish a connection to private.foo.com directly.

You can also use SSH to access protected services on remote hosts and networks without first setting up a 
VPN (Virtual Private Network).
