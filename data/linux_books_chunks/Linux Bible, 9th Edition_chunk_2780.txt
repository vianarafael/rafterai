Part IV: Becoming a Linux Server Administrator

To start a service, you simply use a start option instead of a stop option on the end of 
the service command as follows.

# service cups start
Starting cups:         [  OK  ]
# service cups status
cupsd (pid 6860) is running...

To restart a SysVinit service, the restart option is used.
