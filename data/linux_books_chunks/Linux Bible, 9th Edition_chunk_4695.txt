The original server then acknowledges 
(ACK) the response, and a TCP connection is ofÔ¨Å cially established. This three-way 
handshake is often called a SYN-SYN-ACK or SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK.

If you select a TCP Connect port scan, the nmap utility uses this three-way hand-
shake to do a little investigative activity on a remote server.
