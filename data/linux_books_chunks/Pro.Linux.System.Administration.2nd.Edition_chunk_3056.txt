If you specify an incorrect hostname, you 
will get an error about a mismatch between the server and certificate name. In this case, we specify mail.
example.com, which is the fully qualified hostname of the e-mail server.

Then specify the e-mail address of the contact for the certificate, in this case admin@example.com.
Last, you are prompted for some extra attributes for the certificate.
