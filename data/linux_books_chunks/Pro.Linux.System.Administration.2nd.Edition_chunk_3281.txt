To do this, you can install a package called maildrop, which contains the maildirmake command, a more 
sophisticated version of the maildirmake.dovecot command.

You can then use the maildirmake command to create the skeleton directory and any required folders.

$ sudo maildirmake /etc/skel/Maildir
$ sudo maildirmake -f Sent /etc/skel/Maildir
$ sudo maildirmake -f Trash /etc/skel/Maildir
$ sudo maildirmake -f Drafts /etc/skel/Maildir
$ sudo maildirmake -f Spam /etc/skel/Maildir

Here weâ€™ve used the -f option of the malldirmake command to create folders.
