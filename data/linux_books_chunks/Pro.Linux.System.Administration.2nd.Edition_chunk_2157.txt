Because UUIds are generated randomly or semi-randomly, 
they are hard to guess and so can provide a little bit of security as well.

UUIds are increasingly used on Linux as a way to distinguish components of raId, logical volumes, and 
filesystems. It enables us to manage devices and make them persistent across reboots.
