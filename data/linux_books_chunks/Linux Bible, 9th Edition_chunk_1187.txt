Using the else statement, different words can be echoed if the criterion of the 
if statement isn’t met ($STRING = "Friday"). Keep in mind that it’s good practice to 
put strings in double quotes.

STRING="Friday"
if [ $STRING = "Friday" ] ; then
echo "WhooHoo.  Friday."
else
echo "Will Friday ever get here?"
fi

You can also reverse tests with an exclamation mark (!).
