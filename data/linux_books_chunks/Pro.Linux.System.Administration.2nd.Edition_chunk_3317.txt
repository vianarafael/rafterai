We used the 
openssl s_client command to connect to our e-mail server and pass the STARTTLS command. You can 
see that the e-mail server responded and that we set up an encrypted session. After we issued the EHLO 
command, the e-mail server responded with the supported commands available.

If you connect with just netcat, youâ€™ll see a new command listed here, STARTTLS.
