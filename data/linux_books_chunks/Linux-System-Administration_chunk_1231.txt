This tool allows you to select
whether to compile stuff as a module (m), as part of the kernel (*), or not at all (smaller
kernel size). If you remove too much, your kernel will not work. The configuration will be
stored in the hidden .config file.

[root@RHEL52 linux-2.6.18.i686]# make menuconfig

Issue  a  make  clean  to  prepare  the  kernel  for  compile.
