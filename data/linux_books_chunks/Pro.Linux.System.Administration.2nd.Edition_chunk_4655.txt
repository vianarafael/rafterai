The following 
is a snippet of the LDIF text file we will use to populate our LDAP server:

dn: dc=example,dc=com
objectclass: dcObject
objectClass: organization
dc: example
o: example

This declares that we are going to create the rootDN dc=example,dc=com. According to the dcObject 
object class in the core.schema on Ubuntu, we must include the dc attribute.
