We edit the /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-master.conf file like so:

service lmtp {
 unix_listener /var/spool/postfix/private/dovecot-lmtp {
   group = postfix
   mode = 0600
   user = postfix
  }
}

Lastly, we need to tell Dovecot to strip the domain away from the username when delivering the mail. 
The LMTP process gets the username from RCPT TO:, and we need to strip the domain off.
