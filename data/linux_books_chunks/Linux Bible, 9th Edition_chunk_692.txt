The two forms of command substitu-
tion are $(command) and `command` (backticks, not single quotes).

The command in this case can include options, metacharacters, and arguments. The follow-
ing is an example of using command substitution:

$ vi $(find /home | grep xyzzy)

In this example, the command substitution is done before the vi command is run.
