After the password 
has been accepted by cracklib, the passwd command asks you to enter the new password 
a second time to make sure there are no typos (which are hard to detect when you can’t see 
what you are typing).

When running as root, changing a user’s password is possible by supplying that user’s login 
name as a parameter to the passwd command.
