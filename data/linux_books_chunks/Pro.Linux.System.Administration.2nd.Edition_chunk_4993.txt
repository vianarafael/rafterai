However, most daemons don’t use shells, so adding limits to the shell 
configuration files won’t have any effect.

You can instead use the limits module for PAM. This module is invoked when a user creates a new 
process, and it sets limits that you can define in /etc/security/limits.conf. This file defines both soft and 
hard limits for users and groups.
