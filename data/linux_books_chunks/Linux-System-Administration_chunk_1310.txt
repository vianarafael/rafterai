This  requires  adding
usrquota and/or grpquota to one or more of the file systems in /etc/fstab.

root@RHELv4u4:~# cat /etc/fstab | grep usrquota
/dev/VolGroup00/LogVol02     /home     ext3     usrquota,grpquota   0 0

Next you need to remount the file system.

root@RHELv4u4:~# mount -o remount /home

The next step is to build the quota.user and/or quota.group files.
