Troubleshooting boot order
Depending on the hardware attached to your computer, a typical boot order might boot 
a CD/DVD drive ﬁ rst, then the hard drive, then a USB device, and ﬁ nally the network 
interface card. The BIOS would go to each device, looking for a boot loader in the master 
boot record for that device. If the BIOS ﬁ nds a boot loader, it starts it.
