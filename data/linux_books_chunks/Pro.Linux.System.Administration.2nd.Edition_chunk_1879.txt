You saw this when you installed your host in Chapter 2 and selected the packages you 
wanted as part of that process.

In addition, you can see the license the package is released under (in this case, the GPLv2 license), the 
size of the package and, most important, a description and summary of the package and some links to more 
information about the package.

Sometimes you will want to know what package installed a particular file or command.
