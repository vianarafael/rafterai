Hereâ€™s an example of a script that uses the read command:

#!/bin/bash
read -p "Type in an adjective, noun and verb (past tense): " a1 n1 v1
echo "He sighed and $v1 to the elixir. Then he ate the $a1 $n1."

In this script, after prompting for an adjective, noun, and verb, the user is expected to 
enter words that are then assigned to the adj1, noun1, and verb1 variables.
