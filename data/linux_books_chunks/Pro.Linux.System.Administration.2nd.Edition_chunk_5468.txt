The host that we intend to build 
uses a network query to find a PXE boot server, usually a network query to a DHCP server, that might offer it 
the files required to boot and then transfers those files to the host using a file transfer protocol called Trivial 
File Transfer Protocol (TFTP).

 You can read more about pXe at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_

 ■ Note 
Environment.

Once this initial boot takes place, your provisioning process continues by installing a prepackaged 

version of your distribution, usually with a series of automated scripted responses to the various 
configuration questions you are prompted for when installing.

 We’re using network-based provisioning to create our hosts rather than any of the alternatives,
