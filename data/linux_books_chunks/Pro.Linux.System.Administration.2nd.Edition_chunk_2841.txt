First, letâ€™s see the current list of services allowed by the firewall.

$ sudo firewall-cmd --list-services
dhcpv6-client ssh

We need to add the http service. We do that with firewall-cmd again.

$ sudo firewall-cmd --add-service http --permanent
$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload

This will add the service to the public zone by default.
