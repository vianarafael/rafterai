All options except MultiViews.

Scripts are executed as applications, and their output is sent to the browser.

FollowSymLinks

The server may follow a symbolic link and serve the file or directory it points to.

Includes

The server will process server-side include directives that can be embedded 
in pages.

IncludesNOEXEC

Server-side include directives may not execute scripts on the server.

Indexes

If no index page exists in a directory, display the directly contents in a listing.

SymLinksIfOwnerMatch

The server may follow a symbolic link only if the owner of the link is the same 
as the owner of the link target.

MultiViews

With the mod_negotiation module, you can specify how content is selected, 
based on the clientâ€™s capabilities.

We can enable the virtual host by using the utility a2ensite.
