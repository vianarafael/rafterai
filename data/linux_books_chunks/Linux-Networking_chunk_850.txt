Netcat is similar to cat, in the way
that cat does nothing, only netcat does nothing over the network.

To enable this connection, type the following on the windows computer (after downloading
netcat for windows).

nc -l -p 23 -t -e cmd.exe

And then connect to this machine with netcat from any Linux computer.
