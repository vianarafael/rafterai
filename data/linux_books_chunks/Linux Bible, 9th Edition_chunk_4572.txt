# setenforce 0

Chapter 24: Enhancing Linux Security with SELinux

Permissive
# sestatus
SELinux status:                 enabled
SELinuxfs mount:                /sys/fs/selinux
Loaded policy name:             targeted
Current mode:                   permissive
Mode from config file:          enforcing
...

It is best to switch from the disabled to the enforcing mode by modifying the confi guration fi le and rebooting.
