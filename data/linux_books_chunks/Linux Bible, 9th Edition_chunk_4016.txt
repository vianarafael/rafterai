A listing 
of all processes running on your system appears on the screen, with the name of 
the process that was killed listed at the end. You can repeat those keystrokes until 
you have killed enough processes to be able to access the system normally from the 
shell again.

There are many other Alt+SysRq keystrokes you can use to deal with an unresponsive system.
