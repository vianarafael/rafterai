When your browser is 

configured to use the cache, Squid keeps a local cached copy of any files you retrieve from a web site, so the 
next time the same file is accessed, it can be served from the local Squid cache instead.

The other mode of operation for Squid is as a reverse proxy, which sits in front of one or more web 

servers on the web server side of the connection.
