Each application and command 
you run creates a process. Some processes finish when the command completes, for example, listing the 
contents of a directory. Other processes are more long running and donâ€™t stop until you request them to 
do so or you reboot the host. Some of these long-running processes run applications and services like mail 
and web servers or print or file services.
