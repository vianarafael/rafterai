Host-B is a Linux server, using the Linux Mint distribution, and is on 
the same network as Host-A.

Security settings on various network components, such as the server’s fi rewall and the company’s routers, should all 
be considered when conducting audit scans.

For this audit example, a scan is run from Host-A, using not the loopback address, but 
the actual IP address.
