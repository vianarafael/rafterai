By default both 
Ubuntu and CentOS have ACCEPT as the default policy for all chains in all tables.

The DROP policy discards a packet without notifying the sender, often described as ‘dropping to the floor’. 

The REJECT policy also discards the packet, but it sends an ICMP packet to the sender to tell it the rejection 
has occurred.
