To determine which initialization daemon your server is currently using, consider 

the following:

 ■ You have Upstart if your Linux server runs one of the following distributions: 
RHEL version 6, Fedora versions 9 through 14, Ubuntu versions 6–14.10, or open-
SUSE versions 11.3–12.1, and the strings command shows the Upstart init 
process in use as demonstrated in the following example:

$ strings /sbin/init | grep -i upstart
upstart-devel@lists.ubuntu.com
UPSTART_CONFDIR
UPSTART_NO_SESSIONS
...

 ■ You have the systemd daemon if your Linux server runs Fedora version 15 or 

greater, RHEL 7, Ubuntu 15.04 or OpenSUSE 12.02 or greater.
