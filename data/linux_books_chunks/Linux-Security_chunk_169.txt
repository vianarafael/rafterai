What happens when you log on with the einstime user ? Can you think of a useful real
world example for changing a user's login shell to an application ?

root@debian7:~# su - einstime
Wed Oct 15 11:05:56 UTC 2014 # You get the output of the date command
root@debian7:~#

It can be useful when users need to access only one application on the server.
