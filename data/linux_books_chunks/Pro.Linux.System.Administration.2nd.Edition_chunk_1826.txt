If you want to install the package and the 
dependencies without being prompted for confirmation you can issue

$ sudo yum install –y nmap

This will answer “yes” (-y) to any installation questions and is useful when you are installing packages 

via scripts.

You can also use the groups install command as follows:

$ sudo yum groups install 'Basic Web Server'

This will install all the packages in the group Basic Web Server.
