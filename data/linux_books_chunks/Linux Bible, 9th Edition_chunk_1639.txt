Here is an example of those lines (because of the length of 
the kernel line, it is represented here as three lines):

root (hd0,0)
kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.32-131.17.1.el6.x86_64 ro 
  root=/dev/mapper/vg_myhost-lv_root
 rd_NO_MD rd_NO_DM
  LANG=en_US.UTF-8 SYSFONT=latarcyrheb-sun16 KEYBOARDTYPE=pc
  KEYTABLE=us rhgb quiet crashkernel=auto
initrd /initramfs-2.6.32-131.17.1.el6.x86_64.img

The ﬁ rst line (beginning with root) shows that the entry for the GRUB boot loader is on 
the ﬁ rst partition of the ﬁ rst hard disk (hd0,0).
