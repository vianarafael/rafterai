We will look here at the worker and event 

MPMs.

For both worker and event performance, there are two primary performance options that can 
be adjusted. The first is ThreadsPerChild, and the second is MaxRequestWorkers. ThreadsPerChild 
describes how many server threads are created from each child process. MaxRequestWorkers determines 
the maximum threads launched in total.
