To do this, use the swaks command and a special file that contains a test virus 
signature called eicar.txt, as we demonstrate here:

$ swaks -tls -a -au ataylor -ap password -t jsmith@example.com -f ataylor@example.com --body 
eicar.txt

Weâ€™ve again used the swaks command to send an e-mail to jsmith@example.com.
