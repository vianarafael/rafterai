You also need to 
install an update tool called FreshClam that automatically downloads and updates the virus signatures that 
ClamAV uses to detect viruses.

On CentOS, the process of installing ClamAV is via these packages:

$ sudo yum install -y clamav-scanner clamav-update clamav-server-systemd clamav-milter-
systemd sendmail-milter

On Ubuntu, you install the clamav and clamav-daemon packages.
