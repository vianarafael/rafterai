It is the owner and group assigned to 
the command, respectively, that determines the permissions the command has to access resources 
on the computer. So a set UID command owned by root would run with root permissions; a set GID 
command owned by apache would have apache group permissions.

Examples of applications that have set UID bits turned on are the su and newgrp commands.
