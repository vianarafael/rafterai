This example shows how to create a new mount point with mkdir.

root@RHELv4u2:~# mkdir /home/project42

7.1.2. mount

When the mount point is created, and a file system is present on the partition, then mount
can mount the file system on the mount point directory.

root@RHELv4u2:~# mount -t ext2 /dev/sdb1 /home/project42/

Once mounted, the new file system is accessible to users.
