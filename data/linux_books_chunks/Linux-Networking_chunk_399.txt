apache configuration

There are many similarities, but also a couple of differences when configuring apache on
Debian or on CentOS. Both Linux families will get their own chapters with examples.

All configuration on RHEL/CentOS is done in /etc/httpd.

[root@centos65 ~]# ls -l /etc/httpd/
total 8
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 May  6 13:08 conf
drwxr-xr-x.
