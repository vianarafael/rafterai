In  the
screenshot below we put the root user and password in .my.cnf.

kevin@ubu1204:~$ pwd
/home/kevin
kevin@ubu1204:~$ cat .my.cnf 
[client]
user=root
password=hunter2
kevin@ubu1204:~$

This enables us to log on as the root mysql user just by typing mysql.

kevin@ubu1204:~$ mysql
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.
