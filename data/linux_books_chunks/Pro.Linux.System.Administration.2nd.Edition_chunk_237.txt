You are asked to provide a password. 
Note that you need to input this password at boot time, so this option is not suitable 
for a remote or headless server. If you lose the encryption password, you will not be 
able to retrieve your data.

â€¢	 Manual: This option opens the partition editor and allows you to manually configure 
partitions, software raid, encryption, and LVM.
