We 

call our command check_load_ssh. The command_line part specifies that we’re executing the check_by_ssh 
plug-in and connecting to the host specified by the -H option.

The -l option specifies the name of the user we want to connect to on the remote host; here we’re using 

the nagios user we just created.

The -C specifies the command we want to run on the remote host.
