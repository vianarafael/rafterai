tables in those databases are stored in /var/lib/
mysql/<databasename>/<tablename.frm>.

When data in a table changes in memory (e.g., because you insert a record), innodb stores it in its redo 
logs. When these transaction logs fill up, the Mariadb server flushes these changed data records to the 
table files.

One of the reasons for this is performance, just like with a journaling filesystem.
