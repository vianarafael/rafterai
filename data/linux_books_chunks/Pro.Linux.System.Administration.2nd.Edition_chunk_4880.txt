It is highly configurable and works out of the box to collect metrics for you.
We are going to use Collectd to gather metrics from our hosts and send them to Graphite, a metrics 
collection store. However, you can write metrics to many other back ends using the Write HTTP or Network 
plug-in.

You can install Collectd on both Ubuntu and CentOS via your package manager.
