Launching Mozilla Thunderbird

If this is the first time you’ve launched Thunderbird, the Account Wizard will start. This wizard allows 
you to create an account with a service provider. You can create a new account by selecting Preferences ➤ 
Account Settings and clicking Add Account.

By now most people will be familiar with setting up an e-mail client.
