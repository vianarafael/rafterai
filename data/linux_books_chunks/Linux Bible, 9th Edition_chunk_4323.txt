If an ISO ﬁ le has an SHA-1 hash listed, instead of an MD5 checksum, you 
can use the following to check the hash.

$ sha1sum Fedora-Live-Desktop-x86_64-20-1.iso

Unfortunately, as of 2005, the SHA-1 hash standard was no longer considered to be a 
 cryptographic hash due to some “mathematical weaknesses.” However, as with the MD5, 
that has not diminished its popularity for checking ﬁ le integrity.

If your particular organization requires a true cryptographic hash utility, you must use one 
of the SHA-2 cryptographic hash tools.
