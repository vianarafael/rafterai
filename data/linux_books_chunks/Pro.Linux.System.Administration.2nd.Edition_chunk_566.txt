Thus it is important that you understand 
how permissions work and how to change them.

There are three commonly assigned types of permissions for files:

•	

Read, indicated by the letter r

•	 Write, indicated by the letter w

•	

Execute, indicated by the letter x

 ■ Note 
 There are two other types of permissions, sticky and setuid/setgid permissions, represented by t or 
s characters, respectively.
