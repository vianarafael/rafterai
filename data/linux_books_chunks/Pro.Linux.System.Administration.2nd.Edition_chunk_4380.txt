As a result of PAM’s ability to plug in a variety of authentication mechanisms, we 
can use it to include authentication mechanisms such as the following:

•	

•	

Local Linux users

Two-factor authentication such as RSA tokens or smartcards

719

Chapter 15 ■ NetworkiNg with VpNs

•	

•	

•	

•	

Kerberos

RADIUS

IMAP (against an IMAP server)

LDAP

We’re going to show you how to configure basic local-user authentication—that is, your users will have 
a Linux user on the gateway host, and they will be authenticated as if they were logging on to that host using 
the console or via SSH.
