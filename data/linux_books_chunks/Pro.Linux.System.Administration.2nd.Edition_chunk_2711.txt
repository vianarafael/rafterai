We will specify the 
hmac-sha512 algorithm with the -a option, give the key a name with –k option and declare the zone with –z 
option.

# ddns-confgen -a hmac-sha512 -k dynamic-update-key -z example.com
# To activate this key, place the following in named.conf, and
# in a separate keyfile on the system or systems from which nsupdate
# will be run:
key "dynamic-update-key" {
        algorithm hmac-sha512;
        secret "kHATLZ8hl4RbSoe7W71pqaGZ3oCIP3WIgZZI/UcXYzbOooCOTS3cN7lFdQ/+97VYVfFYEGmzRCq
RKyj4AcLfdg==";
};

# Then, in the "zone" definition statement for "example.com",
# place an "update-policy" statement like this one, adjusted as
# needed for your preferred permissions:
update-policy {
         grant dynamic-update-key zonesub ANY;
};

# After the keyfile has been placed, the following command will
# execute nsupdate using this key:
nsupdate -k <keyfile>
