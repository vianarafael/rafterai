GRUB2 has made the grub.cfg more modular than its simpler predecessor. The chance 
that you will need to make many changes to the GRUB2 configuration is small but possible.

The GRUB2 files are located in different places on different distributions. On Red Hat-based hosts like 

CentOS, they can be found at /boot/grub2/grub.cfg (and the file is usually linked symbolically to /etc/
grub.conf).
