For different Linux systems, you need to 
ﬁ nd the name of the service and the correct tool to start the smbd daemon.

In Fedora and RHEL 7, to enable Samba to start when the system boots and start Samba 
immediately, type the following from the command line as root:

# systemctl enable smb.service
# systemctl start smb.service
# systemctl status smb.service
smb.service - Samba SMB Daemon
  Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/smb.service; enabled)
  Active: active (running) since Sun 2014-08-31 07:23:37 EDT; 6s ago
 Main PID: 4838 (smbd)
CGroup: /system.slice/smb.service
  ├ 4838 /usr/sbin/smbd
  └ 4840 /usr/sbin/smbd

The ﬁ rst systemctl command enables the service, the second starts it immediately, and 
the third shows the status.
