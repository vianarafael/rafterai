open proxy servers

You can find lists of open proxy servers on the internet that enable you to surf anonymously.
This works when the proxy server connects on your behalf to a website, without logging
your ip-address. But be careful, these (listed) open proxy servers could be created in order
to eavesdrop upon their users.
