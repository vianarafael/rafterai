These are the ports you should open to get a 
working Samba service on your Linux system:

 ■ TCP port 445—This is the primary port the Samba smbd daemon listens on. Your 
ﬁ rewall must support incoming packet requests on this port for Samba to work.

 ■ TCP port 139—The smbd daemon also listens on TCP port 139, to handle sessions 
associated with NetBIOS hostnames.
