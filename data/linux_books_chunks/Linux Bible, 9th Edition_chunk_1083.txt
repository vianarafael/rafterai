Job 2 shows the find command I just ran. 
Jobs 3 and 4 show nroff commands currently running in the background. Job 5 had been 
running in the shell (foreground) until I decided too many processes were running and 
pressed Ctrl+Z to stop job 5 until a few processes had completed.

The plus sign (+) next to number 5 shows that it was most recently placed in the  background.
