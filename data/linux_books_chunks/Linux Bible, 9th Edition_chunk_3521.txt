If your computer has a network interface connected to a local network and one 
connected to the Internet, consider allowing access only to the local network.

To set which interfaces Samba listens on, uncomment the interfaces line in the 
[global] section of the smb.conf Ô¨Å le. Then add the interface names or IP address ranges 
of those computers you want to allow access to your computer.
