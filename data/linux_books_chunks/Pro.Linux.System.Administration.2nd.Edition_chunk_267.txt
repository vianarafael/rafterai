For example, if an 
installation kernel does not support the disk controller, the installer will be unable to access hard disks. 
If this happens, check which kernel version is included on the installation disc and verify that it in fact 
supports your hardware. A newer version of your distribution, with support for more and newer hardware, 
might be available.
