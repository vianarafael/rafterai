A contactgroup object looks like this:

define contactgroup{
          contactgroup_name       admins
          alias                   Nagios Administrators
          members                 nagios-admin
          }

A contact group has a name defined via the contactgroup_name attribute, a description provided by the 
alias attribute, and a list of the contacts in that group, specified using the members attribute.
