The slaptest command is useful 

for converting the text-based schema files to LDIF format.

We will pass the /etc/ldap/schema/exampleactive.schema into slaptest, and the output file will be 

generated in a temporary SLAPD config directory.

First create a temporary directory to hold our converted files.

$ sudo mkdir /etc/ldap/ldif_converted && cd /etc/ldap

In this directory we will now create a file called schema_load.conf in the old slapd.conf format that 

will be used to direct the slaptest command to read in our schema file.
