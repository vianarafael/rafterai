It is going to write zeros in 100 files 
in the mount directory of incrementing sizes.

$ for a in {1..100} ; do sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/datafile${a} bs=4096 count=$a ;done
....
100+0 records in
100+0 records out
409600 bytes (410 kB, 400 KiB) copied, 0.0287382 s, 14.3 MB/s

We can see that the test data files have been created, and when take a look at df, we will see that all 

hosts are reporting the same disk usage for their bricks.

$ df -h /data/brick1_r1/
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sdc        50G   62M  50G   1% /data/brick1_r1

Letâ€™s do another exercise.
