If you decide to 
keep downloaded packages after they are installed (they are removed by default, based on 
the keepcache=0 setting in the /etc/yum.conf ﬁ le), your cache directories (under
/var/cache/yum) can ﬁ ll up. Metadata stored in cache directories can be cleared, causing 
fresh metadata to be downloaded from all enabled YUM repositories the next time yum is 
run.
