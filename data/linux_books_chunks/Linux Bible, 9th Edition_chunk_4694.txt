Its primary purpose is to negotiate and initiate a 
connection using what is called a “three-way handshake.” TCP sends a synchronize 
packet (SYN) to a remote server, specifying a speciﬁ c port number in the packet. 
The remote server receives the SYN and replies with an acknowledgment packet 
(SYN-ACK) to the originating computer.
