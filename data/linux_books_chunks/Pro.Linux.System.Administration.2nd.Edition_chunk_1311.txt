It should now look similar to Listing 7-1.

We can also remove an interface. When we “down” a link, we don’t remove the IP address. To do that we 

would issue the following:

$ sudo ip addr del 192.168.10.1/24 dev enp0s8

The link is still up and the IPv4 address has gone if you now show the interface. You should notice that 

the IPv6 address will be available as long as the link is UP.
