adding winbind to nsswitch.conf

The winbind daemon is talking with the Active Directory domain.

We need to update the /etc/nsswitch.conf file now, so user group and host names can be
resolved against the winbind daemon.

[root@RHEL52 samba]# vi /etc/nsswitch.conf 
[root@RHEL52 samba]# grep winbind /etc/nsswitch.conf 
passwd:     files winbind
group:      files winbind
hosts:      files dns winbind
