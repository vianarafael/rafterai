Hard links are created by default, and soft links are created by 

adding the -s switch. There are a few ways the ln command can be used, but the simplest is to create a link 
to a target file as follows:

$ ln -s /home/jsmith/myfile

The previous line would create a symbolic link called myfile to the /home/jsmith/myfile file.
