All types of hard disks—for example, ATA, Serial ATA, SCSI, SAS, and SSD—are 
represented by device files whose names start with sd, which stands for SCSI disk, as all these different types 
of drives are accessed as if they were SCSI drives.

 ■ Note  SCSI is an acronym that stands for Small Computer System Interface, a specification for how storage 
devices should be connected to and accessed by computers.
