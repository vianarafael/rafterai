This querying is done either directly 
to the host (for example, connecting to the SMTP server on port 25 and testing you can receive e-mail) or via

the following:

An escalation model allows alerts to be escalated if a host or service does not recover

You have the ability to specify event handlers that can be triggered when a host 
or service fails.
