Centos7 VM is almost ready

We can change the settings for our new virtual host or add more storage devices. We need to add a 

storage device to boot our operating system from. So we will select Settings and go to the storage tab. You 
can see we have an IDE controller that is Empty. We can click on the little DVD symbol and select Choose 
Optical Virtual Disk File.
