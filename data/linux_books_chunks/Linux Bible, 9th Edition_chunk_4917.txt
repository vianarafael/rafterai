Note 
that the location of the mount point directory on each hypervisor must be the same. 
Hereâ€™s how:

a.  Check the NFS share availability. From each of the two hypervisors, make sure 

that you can see the available share by typing the following:

# showmount -e storage.example.com
Export list for storage.example.com:

/var/storage 192.168.0.*

b.  Mount the NFS share.
