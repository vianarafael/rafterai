Some 
 administrators like using an undeﬁ ned group number under 1000 so the group they create 
doesn’t intrude on the group designations above 1000 (so UID and GID numbers can go 
along in parallel).

To change a group later, use the groupmod command. For example:

# groupmod -g 330 jokers
# groupmod -n jacks jokers

In the ﬁ rst example, the group ID for jokers is changed to 330.
