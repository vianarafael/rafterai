But because we intend to conÔ¨Å gure storage from a sepa-
rate node on the network, we address that issue later.

To check that the available features of your computers meet the requirements, boot a Linux 
live CD or DVD, open a Terminal window, and type the following commands:

# cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep --color -E "vmx|svm|lm"
flags  : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca
   cmov pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht tm pbe
   syscall nx pdpe1gb rdtscp lm constant_tsc arch_perfmon pebs bts
   rep_good xtopology nonstop_tsc aperfmperf pni pclmulqdq dtes64
   monitor ds_cpl vmx smx es...
...

The previous command shows that this computer is a 64-bit computer (lm) and that an 
Intel chip supports virtualization features (vmx).
