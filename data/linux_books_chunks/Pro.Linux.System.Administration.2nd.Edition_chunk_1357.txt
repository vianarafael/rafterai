NetworkManager, if it is configured to do so, will read 
and write to these files. The configuration profile files, like ifcfg-enp0s3, are read in by NetworkManager 
and will pass off the device name to the ifup script. If the device is already connected and managed by 
NetworkManager, ifup will use the nmcli to manage the interface.
