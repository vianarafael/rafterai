RELP is more mature than the remote logging of Journald and has been battle tested by thousands 
of installations. It is also fairly simple to configure, and the modules can be installed with package 
management.

$ sudo yum install –y rsyslog-relp rsyslog-gnutls
$ sudo aptitude install –y rsyslog-relp rsyslog-gnutls

We will need to configure the client and server.
