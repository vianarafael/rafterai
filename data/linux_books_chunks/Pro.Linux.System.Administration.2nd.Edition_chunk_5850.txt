We do this 
using some tools that came when we installed Serverspec.

$ rake spec:ansible

Package "apache2"
  should be installed (FAILED - 1)

Service "apache2"
  should be enabled (FAILED - 2)
  should be running (FAILED - 3)

Port "80"
  should be listening (FAILED - 4)

To run our tests, we are going to execute whatâ€™s called a rake task.
