In the next screen, you 
could select the DHCP option and get an IP address automatically.

 ■ Caution  adding your own Ip addresses to your network can cause “collisions.” That is where two hosts 
with the same address appear on the network causing confusion as to where to send traffic.

From the Network screen, we click Configure and we see a screen similar to Figure 2-10.
