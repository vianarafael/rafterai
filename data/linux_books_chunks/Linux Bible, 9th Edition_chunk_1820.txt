The --replacepkgs option enables you to reinstall an exist-
ing version of a package (if, for example, you had mistakenly deleted some components), and 
the --oldpackage enables you to install an earlier version of a package.

# rpm -Uhv --replacepkgs emacs-common-24.4-3.fc21.x86_64.rpm
# rpm -Uhv --oldpackage zsh-4.3.10-7.el6.x86_64.rpm

You can remove a package with the -e option.
