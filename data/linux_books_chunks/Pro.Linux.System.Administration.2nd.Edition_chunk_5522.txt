You don’t need to do 
this, but it is useful if you have a specific role in mind for a host and want to specify a particular profile or 
Kickstart configuration.

To do this, you add hosts to Cobbler, identifying them via their MAC or IP addresses, using the system 

command.

$ sudo cobbler system add --name=web1.example.com --mac=08:00:27:66:EF:C2 
--profile=CentOS7-x86_64 --interface eth1

Here we’ve added a system named web1.example.com with the specified MAC address.

 You can usually see your MaC address during the network boot process, or you can often find it
