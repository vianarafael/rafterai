Share the directory with Samba.

You smb.conf.readonly could look like this:
[global]
 workgroup = WORKGROUP
 server string = Read Only File Server
 netbios name = STUDENTx
 security = share

[readonlyX]
 path = /srv/samba/readonly
 comment = read only file share
 read only = yes
 guest ok = yes

test with testparm before going in production!
