After installing the package or booting up 
the Live CD, type in chkrootkit at the command line. It searches the entire ﬁ le structure, 
denoting any infected ﬁ les.

The code that follows shows a run of chkrootkit on an infected system. The grep com-
mand was used to search for the key word INFECTED. Notice that many of the ﬁ les listed 
as “infected” are bash shell command ﬁ les.
