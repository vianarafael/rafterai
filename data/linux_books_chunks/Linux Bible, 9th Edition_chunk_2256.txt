There 
are two major facilities for managing services: systemd (used now by RHEL 7, Ubuntu, and 
Fedora) and SystemVinit scripts (used by Red Hat Enterprise Linux  through RHEL 6.x).

Regardless of which facility is used on your Linux system, it is your job to do such things 
as set whether you want the service to come up when the system boots and to start, stop, 
and reload the service as needed (possibly to load new conﬁ guration ﬁ les or temporarily 
stop access to the service).
