However, if you are blocking access 
in the hosts.deny ﬁ le to all services that have not been explicitly allowed (by adding an 
ALL:ALL line to hosts.deny), adding a line such as the following to the beginning of the 
/etc/hosts.allow ﬁ le allows access to the vsftpd server:

vsftpd:   ALL :  ALLOW

For more information on how to use TCP wrappers, refer to Chapter 25, “Securing Linux on a 
Network,” or the hosts.allow man page (type man hosts.allow).

Confi guring SELinux for your FTP server
If SELinux is set to Permissive or Disabled, it does not block access to the vsftpd service 
in any way.
