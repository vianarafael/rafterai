You can do that in 
several ways:

 ■ Add the acl option to the ﬁ fth ﬁ eld in the line in the /etc/fstab ﬁ le that 

 automatically mounts the ﬁ lesystem when the system boots up.

 ■ Implant the acl line in the Default mount options ﬁ eld in the ﬁ lesystem’s super block, 
so the acl option is used whether the ﬁ lesystem is mounted automatically or manually.

 ■ Add the acl option to the mount command line when you mount the ﬁ lesystem 

manually with the mount command.

Keep in mind that in Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems, you only have to add 
the acl mount option to those ﬁ lesystems you create after Linux is installed.
