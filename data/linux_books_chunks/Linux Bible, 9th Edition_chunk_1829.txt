Although it is  normal 
for conﬁ guration ﬁ les to change over time, it is not normal for binaries (the commands in
/bin, /sbin, and so on) to change after installation. Binaries that are changed are prob-
ably an indication that your system has been cracked.

In this example, I’m going to install the zsh package and mess it up.
