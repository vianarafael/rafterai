With yum and rpm commands, you have more ﬂ exibility with exactly which packages 
related to an application or other software feature is installed on your system.

 ■ More complex queries—Using commands such as yum and rpm, you can get 

detailed information about packages, package groups, and repositories.

 ■ Software validation—Using rpm and other tools, you can check whether a 

signed package has been modiﬁ ed before you installed it or whether any of the 
 components of a package have been tampered with since the package was installed.

 ■ Managing software installation—Although the Software window works well if 
you are installing desktop software on a single system, it doesn’t scale well for 
 managing software on multiple systems.
