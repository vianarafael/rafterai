By default, 
HTML content is stored in the /var/www/html directory (as determined by the value of 
DocumentRoot in the httpd.conf ﬁ le).

For the httpd daemon to be able to access that content, standard Linux permissions apply: 
If read permission is not on for “other” users, it must be on for the apache user or group 
for the ﬁ les to be read and served to clients.
