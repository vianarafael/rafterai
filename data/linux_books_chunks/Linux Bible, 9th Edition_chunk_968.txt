For example, if you search for passwd, you could turn up /etc/passwd, 
/usr/bin/passwd, /home/chris/passwd/pwdfiles.txt, and many other 
ﬁ les with passwd in the path.

 ■ If you add ﬁ les to your system after updatedb runs, you can’t locate those 

ﬁ les until updatedb runs again (probably that night).
