The fi rst obvious difference between vi 
and vim is that any known text fi le type, such as HTML, C code, or a common confi guration fi le, appears in color. 
The colors indicate the structure of the fi le. Other features of vim that are not in vi include features such as visual 
 highlighting and split-screen mode.
