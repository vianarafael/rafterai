We are going to use a command called getent to query the passwd file 
and the sssd (as directed by our configuration in nsswitch.conf; getent is a tool for querying those entries).

$ getent passwd ataylor
ataylor:*:1002:1000:Angela Taylor:/home/ataylor:

We have been returned the user details for Angela Taylor, including the UID/GID and home directory 

information.
