This again adds richness to 
the data we can later use to extract and transform and filter our data.

Our output is going to our Logstash server on the monitor.example.com host. We are going to use 
TLS-encrypted transport to send our data. We are not anonymizing our logs here, so anything that is sent 
to the monitoring host can be read in clear text, making us vulnerable to snooping.
