If you install 
the bind-chroot package, bind conﬁ guration ﬁ les are moved under the /var/named/
chroot directory, which attempts to replicate the ﬁ les from /etc and /var that are 
needed to conﬁ gure bind, so that the named daemon (which provides the service) is con-
ﬁ ned to the /etc/named/chroot directory structure.

If you are interested in trying out bind, I recommend you ﬁ rst try it out by conﬁ guring 
DNS for a small home network behind a ﬁ rewall as a way to make it easier for the people in 
your household to communicate with each other.
