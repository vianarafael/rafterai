We now instruct FPM to go into that directory and create a deb package for us. We let FPM do its 
magic by issuing the following:

$ sudo fpm -s dir -t deb -n nginx -v 1-10.1 -C /tmp/installdir/

Here we have specified â€“s for the source type of dir, which means directory. The target (-t) is a debian 

package. This would be -t rpm if we were building a RPM package.
