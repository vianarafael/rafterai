If it does exist, its content will be overwritten.

 â–  Caution 

 Be careful when using redirection, as your target file will be overwritten without warning.

You can also append to files using the same mechanism.

$ cat /home/jsmith/myfile >> /home/jsmith/yourfile

Using the >> syntax will append the output from the cat of myfile to the end of yourfile.
