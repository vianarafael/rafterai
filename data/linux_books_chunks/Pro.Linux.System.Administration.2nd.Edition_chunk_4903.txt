Next, we may have 
an h or an s zero or more times ([hs]?). Then we anchor around the d, followed by any a to z disk ([a-z]). 
Then, we expect zero or more partition numbers (\d?). Finally, the end of the line is also matched ($).

When we match with IgnoreSelected false, we should be able to match on our disk names.
