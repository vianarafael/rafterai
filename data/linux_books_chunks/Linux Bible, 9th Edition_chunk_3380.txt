The Very Secure 
FTP Daemon (vsftpd package) is available for Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, 
and other Linux systems.

A default vsftpd server allows anonymous users to download ﬁ les from the server and 
regular Linux users to upload or download ﬁ les (provided some security settings are 
changed). Moving around on an FTP server is similar to moving around a Linux ﬁ lesystem.
