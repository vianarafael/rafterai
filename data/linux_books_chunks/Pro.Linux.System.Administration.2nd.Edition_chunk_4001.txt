We are going to use AWS in this example, but 
you could just as easily use Dropbox, RackSpace Cloudfiles, Google Cloud Storage, or more, as listed in the 
Duplicity man page.

In this exercise, we are going to do the following things:

•	 Create an S3 bucket with a retention policy

•	 Create a policy that allows access to our bucket

•	 Configure Duply

•	

•	

Test our backup

Set up a cron job to trigger the backup nightly

We will assume that you already have an AWS account and that you have created a user to access it.
