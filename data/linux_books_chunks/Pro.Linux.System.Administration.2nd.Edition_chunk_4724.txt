Because 
LDAP has no write-ahead logs, you cannot replay your most recent updates to your LDAP directory server 
like you can in a fully featured transactional relational database, so regular backups are important. We 
suggest at minimum you make backups nightly.

Managing your directory server via text files can get tiresome.
