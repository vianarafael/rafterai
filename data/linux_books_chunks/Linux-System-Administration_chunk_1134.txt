server configuration

nfs is configured in /etc/exports. You might want some way (ldap?) to synchronize userid's
across computers when using nfs a lot.

The rootsquash option will change UID 0 to the UID of a nobody (or similar) user account.
The sync option will write writes to disk before completing the client request.
