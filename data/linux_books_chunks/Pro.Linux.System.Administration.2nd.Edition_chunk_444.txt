On a 
Linux host, most users have a special directory, called a home directory, which is created when the user 
is created. Like a Microsoft Window’s user profile, the user’s preferences and configuration files and data 
are stored in this directory. Any time you see the ~ symbol used, it indicates a shortcut that means home 
directory.
