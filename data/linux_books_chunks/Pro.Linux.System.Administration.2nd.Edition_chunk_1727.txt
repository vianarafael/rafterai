On a CentOS 
host we can perform the same iptables instructions via firewall-cmd. In this example we are going to add 
enp0s8 to the external zone, then configure IP masquerading on that interface. Then we are going to ‘port 
forward’ port 80 to our internal host on 192.168.0.1:80.

First we need to set our enp0s8 interface to be in the external zone.
