The new user is always the only member of this group.

But earlier we said that the default group for useradd was 100? Why isn’t that used? If you use the –N 
(no-user-group) option to useradd or if the setting USERGROUPS_ENAB in the login.defs file is ‘no’ then the 
default group of 100 (users) will be assigned.
