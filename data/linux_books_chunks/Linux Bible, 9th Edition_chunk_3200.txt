Generate a 1024-bit RSA private key and save it to a Ô¨Å le:

# cd /etc/pki/tls/private
# openssl genrsa -out server.key 1024
# chmod 600 server.key

You can use a fi lename other than server.key and should do so if you plan to have more than one SSL host on 
your machine (which requires more than one IP address).
