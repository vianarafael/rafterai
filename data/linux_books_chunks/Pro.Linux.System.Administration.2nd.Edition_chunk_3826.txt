The syntax is the following:

$ sudo gluster volume set <volume name> <option> <value>

So in our case, we would issue the following to change the network.ping-timeout setting:

$ sudo gluster volume set vol1 network.ping-timeout 15

If we look at the volume information, we will now see our change in the Options Reconfigured section.

$ sudo gluster volume info

Expanding GlusterFS Volume Storage

Of course, there will be time you need to expand the size of your storage, and that is where Gluster is a great 
performer, compared to alternatives like plain old NFS.
