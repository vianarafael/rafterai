removing a software raid

The software raid is visible in /proc/mdstat when active. To remove the raid completely so
you can use the disks for other purposes, you stop (de-activate) it with mdadm.

[root@rhel6c ~]# mdadm --stop /dev/md0
mdadm: stopped /dev/md0

The disks can now be repartitioned.

Take a look at the man page of mdadm for more information.
