This chapter is going to delve deeper into the workings 
of your Linux host and examine the way it operates “under the hood.”

In this chapter, we’ll look at what happens when your host starts up, or boots. We’ll step through the 
process and show you how to start your host in a variety of modes and how to configure and modify the 
startup process.
