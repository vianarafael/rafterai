Provided you have enough hard 

disks, you can grow the size of a RAID 5 array as well. This causes data to be shifted and checksums to be 
recalculated, so it will take some time to complete. Youâ€™ll add a sixth disk, /dev/sdg, to your host, so you can 
grow the array and still have a spare device available.
