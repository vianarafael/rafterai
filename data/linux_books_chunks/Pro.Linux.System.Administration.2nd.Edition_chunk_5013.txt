It is synonymous with noatime.

If it is not set, you simply add the noatime option to the options field in the /etc/fstab file for each 

filesystem on which you want to enable this option.

UUID=f87a71b8-a323-4e8e-acc9-efb0758a0642 / ext4 defaults, ïƒ‰
   errors=remount-ro,relatime 0 1

This will enable the option the next time the filesystem is mounted.
