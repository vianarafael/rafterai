And you must show them these terms so 
they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on 
the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute 
and/or modify it.

For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no 
warranty for this free software.
