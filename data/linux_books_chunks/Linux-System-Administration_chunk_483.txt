This is because the filesystem is only set for the size of the
volume before the extension was added.

[root@RHEL5 ~]# df -h | grep resizetest
                      194M  5.6M  149M   4% /home/resizetest

With lvdisplay however we can see that the volume is indeed extended.

[root@RHEL5 ~]# lvdisplay /dev/vg2/lvol0 | grep Size
  LV Size                300.00 MB

To finish the extension, you need resize2fs to span the filesystem over the full size of the
logical volume.

[root@RHEL5 ~]# resize2fs /dev/vg2/lvol0 
resize2fs 1.39 (29-May-2006)
Filesystem at /dev/vg2/lvol0 is mounted on /home/resizetest; on-line re\
sizing required
Performing an on-line resize of /dev/vg2/lvol0 to 307200 (1k) blocks.
The filesystem on /dev/vg2/lvol0 is now 307200 blocks long.
