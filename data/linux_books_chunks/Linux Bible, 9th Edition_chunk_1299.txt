He is given a warning and asked to pro-
vide his password (this is joeâ€™s password, not the root password).

Even after joe has given the password, he must still use the sudo command to run  subsequent 
administrative commands as root (the rm fails, but the sudo rm succeeds). Notice that he is 
not prompted for a password for the second sudo.
