One way to do that is to 
take a generic Linux image (one that is bootable but unconﬁ gured) and provide information 
to conﬁ gure that image to your needs. Another way is to go to a cloud provider, choose an image, 
click through selections to conﬁ gure it, and launch it.

The point is that cloud computing is offering new ways to start up and use Linux systems.
