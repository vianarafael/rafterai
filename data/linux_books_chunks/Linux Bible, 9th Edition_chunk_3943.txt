If a hostname you ask for is not found, all those 
locations are checked before you get some sort of “Host Not Found” message. Here are some 
ways of debugging name-to-address resolution:

 ■ Check if DNS server can be reached. Knowing the name server addresses, you 

can try to ping each name server’s IP address to see if it is accessible. For example: 
ping -c 2 192.168.0.254.
