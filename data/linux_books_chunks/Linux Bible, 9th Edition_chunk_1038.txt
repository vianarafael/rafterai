Each process stores its information in a subdirectory of /proc, named after the process 
ID of that process. You can view some of that raw data by displaying the contents of fi les in one of those directories 
(using cat or less commands).

Listing Processes
From the command line, the ps command is the oldest and most common command for  listing 
processes currently running on your system.
