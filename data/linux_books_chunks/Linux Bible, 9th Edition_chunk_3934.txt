Because there is only the eth0 interface here 
and only a route to the 192.168.0.0 network is shown, all communication not addressed to 
a host on the 192.168.0.0/24 network is sent through the default gateway (192.168.0.1). The 
default gateway is more properly referred to as a router.

To make sure you can reach your router, try to ping it.
