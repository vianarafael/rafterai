In fact, we are 

going to do these extra things:

•	 Create a wrapper script to deny unauthorized commands

•	 On the remote host, create a user and home directory containing .ssh and  

bin directories

•	 Move the SSH wrapper script with authorized commands to the bin directory

•	 Move the authorized_keys to the .ssh directory

•	 Make sure the permissions are correct for each file and directory

Creating the Wrapper Script

First up, we are going to create a file called ssh_limiter.sh, and that will be the script we’ll force our 
connection to run when we connect with the exbackup SSH key.
