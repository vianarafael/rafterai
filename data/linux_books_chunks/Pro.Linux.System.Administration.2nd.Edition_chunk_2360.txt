However in this case 

we have not told lvmextend to resize the filesystem so the filesystem size remains at 2 GiB. While we could 
have got lvextend to resize the filesystem using the â€“r (or --resize) option, we are going to do it ourselves 
manually.

We are now going to tell the filesystem about the new size of the device it is contained on, for which you 

use the xfs_growfs utility.
