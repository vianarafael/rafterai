For 
the Common Name field, you should specify the fully qualified domain name of your server, in our case 
branch1.example.com.

Then we use our CA to sign our certificate as we did earlier.

[ca]$ cd /etc/pki/CA
[ca]$ sudo openssl ca -out branch1.example.com.cert -cert certs/cacert.pem ïƒ‰
-infiles branch1.example.com.req

Now we need to send our certificate and key as well as the CA certificate to the branch server.
