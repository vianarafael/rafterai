We could make this change by editing the main.cf file directly and changing the option as 
shown here:

mydestination = mail.example.com, localhost.localdomain, localhost, example.com

We could also change it using the postconf command.

$ sudo postconf -e "mydestination = mail.example.com, localhost.localdomain, 
localhost, example.com"

On the previous line, we’ve added two items: our mail server and our local domain.
