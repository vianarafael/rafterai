We start Dovecot using the 

systemctl command.

$ sudo systemctl start dovecot

Or, you can check that the Dovecot process is running like so:

$ systemctl status dovecot
● dovecot.service - Dovecot IMAP/POP3 email server
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/dovecot.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: active (running) since Thu 2016-08-25 09:33:09 EDT; 37min ago
   Process: 7172 ExecStartPre=/usr/libexec/dovecot/prestartscript (code=exited, status=0/

SUCCESS)

Here you can see the dovecot and dovecot-auth processes running, indicating that Dovecot has started 

successfully.

On CentOS, Dovecot logs to the /var/log/maillog file and on Ubuntu to the /var/log/mail.log file, 

and you can confirm it is running if you see a log entry like the following:

Jan  7 18:37:03 au-mel-rhel-1  dovecot: Dovecot v1.0.7 starting up

Configuring Postfix for SASL

Next, we need to configure Postfix to use the Dovecot SASL service we’ve just configured.
