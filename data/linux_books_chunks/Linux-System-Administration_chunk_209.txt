When are the variables replaced by their value ? By which shell ?

[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ echo $$ $PPID
4224 4223
[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ bash -c "echo $$ $PPID"

4224 4223
[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ bash -c 'echo $$ $PPID'
5059 4224
[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ bash -c `echo $$ $PPID`
4223: 4224: command not found

The current bash shell will replace the $$ and $PPID while scanning the line, and before
executing the echo command.

[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ echo $$ $PPID
4224 4223

The variables are now double quoted, but the current bash shell will replace $$ and $PPID
while scanning the line, and before executing the bach -c command.

[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ bash -c "echo $$ $PPID"
4224 4223

The  variables  are  now  single  quoted.
