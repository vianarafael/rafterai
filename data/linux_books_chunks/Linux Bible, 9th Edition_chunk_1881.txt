Other Linux systems often assign a new user to the group named users instead.

 ■ -o—Use with -u uid to create a user account that has the same UID as another 
username. (This effectively lets you have two different usernames with authority 
over the same set of ﬁ les and directories.)

 ■ -p passwd—Enter a password for the account you are adding. This must be an 

encrypted password.
