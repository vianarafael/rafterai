This is done by simply issuing the following:

$ sudo semodule â€“i clamav-write.pp

We have told semodule to install (-i) the clamav-write.pp policy into SELinux. We are now ready to 

start the ClamAV services.

Once all the relevant packages have been installed, you need to ensure the ClamAV daemon has been 

enabled and started.
