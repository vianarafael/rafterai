that is represented in binary format as follows:

11000000.10101000.00001010
128+64.128+32+8.8+2

that leaves then a possible 254 possible addresses to be made out of the last octet (0 and 255 cannot 
be used, one being the all-zero address (or base network address) and the other being the all-ones 
address (or broadcast address)â€“these have special meaning and are reserved).

So an iPv4 address of 192.168.10.129/24 would be represented as follows:

11000000.10101000.00001010.10000001
128+64.128+32+8.8+2.128+1

with iPv6 things are slightly different, but the underlying principle is the same.
