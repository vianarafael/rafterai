If you are connecting users in 

your office to a single network, you will need cables, patch panels switches, and most likely a wireless access 
point that can create a wireless network.

 ■ Caution 
 wireless networks are a useful and cheap way to spread your network. they don’t require 
expensive cabling and switches, and your staff can be a bit more mobile in the office.
