Configure Interfaces with nmtui

The curses-based configuration tool that comes with NetworkManager is designed to work on any type of 
terminal. You can create and manage interfaces as well as set the hostname via this terminal user interface 
(tui).

In this exercise we are going to run through the nmtui program to configure our newly attached enp0s8 

Ethernet device.
