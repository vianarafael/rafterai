For RHEL, updates are available as part of the 
 subscription price.

 ■ Disk space—Fedora recommends at least 10GB of disk space for an average  desktop 
installation, although installations can range (depending on which packages you 
choose to install) from 600MB (for a minimal server with no GUI install) to 7GB 
(to install all packages from the installation DVD).
