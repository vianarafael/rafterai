The best way to understand PAM is to examine some PAM configuration files.

On most Linux distributions, you have two possible locations to look for PAM configuration 
information. The legacy file /etc/pam.conf is used to hold PAM configuration information on Linux 
distributions, but now it is generally deprecated and has been replaced by the /etc/pam.d directory.
