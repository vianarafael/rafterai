The 
ﬁ rst virtual workspace in Fedora is where the GUI is and the next six virtual consoles 
are text-based virtual consoles. You can return to the GUI (if one is running) by pressing 
Ctrl+Alt+F1. (On some systems the GUI runs on the virtual console 5 or 6. So you’d return to 
the GUI by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F5 or Ctrl+Alt+F6.)

Try it right now. Hold down the Ctrl+Alt keys, and press F3.
