setroubleshoot

The log file above was not very helpful, but these two packages can make your life much
easier.

[root@centos65 ~]# yum -y install setroubleshoot setroubleshoot-server

You need to reboot for this to work...

So we reboot, restart the httpd server, reactive SELinux Enforce, and do the wget again...
and it fails (because of SELinux).

[root@centos65 ~]# service httpd restart
