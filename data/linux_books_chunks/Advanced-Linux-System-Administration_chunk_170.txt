These filesystems as well as 
the mount options needed (filesystem type, read-write permissions, etc) are defined in a 
separate file.

Sample /etc/auto.extra

cdrom       -fstype=iso9660,ro,user,exec,nodev,nosuid                                :/dev/cdrom

nfs            -fstype=nfs,soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8        192 192.168.3.100:/usr/local

/extra

cdrom

nfs

The CDROM will automatically be accessible in /extra/cdrom and the NFS share is 
mounted as soon as the /extra/nfs directory is accessed 

NOTICE

In the above example:

The directories /extra/cdrom and /extra/nfs must not be created

New entries in /etc/auto.extra are immediately made available: adding 'new -fstype=ext3 
:/dev/hda2' to the file will automatically make /extra/new available

By default a mounted device will stay mounted for 5 minutes: if we uncomment the 
'cdrom' device in the map file /etc/auto.extra shortly after the CDROM has been 
accessed, then the device will still be available for approximately 5 minutes in 
/extra/cdrom
