Each directory begins 
with a d and each ﬁ le begins with a dash (-).

The ﬁ le and directory names are shown in column 7. In this example, a dot (.) represents /
home/joe and two dots (..) represent /home—the parent directory of /joe. Most of the 
ﬁ les in this example are dot (.) ﬁ les that are used to store GUI properties (.kde directory) 
or shell properties (.bash ﬁ les).
