Using public
and private keys they can communicate with encryption and with authentication.

When Alice wants to send an encrypted message to Bob, she uses the public key of Bob.
Bob shares his public key with Alice, but keeps his private key private! Since Bob is the
only one to have Bob's private key, Alice is sure that Bob is the only one that can read the
encrypted message.

When Bob wants to verify that the message came from Alice, Bob uses the public key of
Alice to verify that Alice signed the message with her private key.
