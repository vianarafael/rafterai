pgrep

Similar to the ps -C, you can also use pgrep to search for a process by its command name.

[paul@RHEL5 ~]$ sleep 1000 &
[1] 32558
[paul@RHEL5 ~]$ pgrep sleep
32558
[paul@RHEL5 ~]$ ps -C sleep
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
32558 pts/3    00:00:00 sleep

You can also list the command name of the process with pgrep.

paul@laika:~$ pgrep -l sleep
9661 sleep
