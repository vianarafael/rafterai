So, if you drop your network connection or can’t reach 
the systems you want to communicate with, it’s good to know that there are many tools in 
Linux for looking at the problem.

For client computers (laptops, desktops, and handheld devices), you want to connect to 
the network to reach other computer systems. On a server, you want your clients to be able 
to reach you.
