When the CPU is done with data, that data 
is discarded if it is no longer needed, left in RAM for possible later use, or marked 
to be written to disk for permanent storage if it needs to be saved.

It is important to understand the difference between temporary (RAM) and permanent 
(hard disk) storage, but that doesnâ€™t tell the whole story.
