boot terminology

The  exact  order  of  things  that  happen  when  starting  a  computer  system,  depends  on  the
hardware architecture (Intel x86 is different from Sun Sparc etc), on the boot loader (grub
is different from lilo) and on the operating system (Linux, Solaris, BSD etc). Most of this
chapter is focused on booting Linux on Intel x86 with grub.
