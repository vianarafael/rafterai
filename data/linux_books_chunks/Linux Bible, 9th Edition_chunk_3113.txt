The location tags you generally use and encounter are Directory, 
Files, and Location, which limit the scope of the directives to speciﬁ c directories, ﬁ les, 
or locations, respectively.

 ■ Directory tags are used to specify a path based on the location on the ﬁ lesys-

tem. For instance, <Directory /> refers to the root directory on the computer.
