We’re not going to cover every detail of the boot loader, because you’ll rarely need to change it, and most 
changes to it occur automatically, for example, when you install a new kernel package. But you should 
understand what it does and where it fits into your host’s boot process.

Some history; in the Linux world, there were two main boot loaders that existed: LILO and GRUB.
