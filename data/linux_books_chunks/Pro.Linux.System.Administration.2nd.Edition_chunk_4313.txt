You specify the location of this file in your 
OpenVPN configuration using the secret option.

secret /etc/openvpn/secret.key

You would then copy this file, preferably in a secure way such as via scp or GPG-encrypted file sharing 
(like that offered by https://keybase.io) or by encrypting and using a configuration management system 
and applying it to the other host’s OpenVPN configuration.

We’re not going to use preshared keys, though, because they have some limitations.
