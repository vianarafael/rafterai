Notice how much 
more the /etc/shadow ﬁ le is restricted than the /etc/passwd ﬁ le. For the /etc/
shadow ﬁ le, there is no access permission on, although the root user can still access the 
ﬁ le. So if only root can view this ﬁ le, how can a user change his or her password because it 
is stored in /etc/shadow? The passwd utility, /usr/bin/passwd, uses the special per-
mission SUID.
