Being unconstrained by SELinux, httpd can do 
these things:

 ■ Access any ﬁ le or directory, based on read/write/execute permissions for the asso-

ciated owner and group.

 ■ Perform potentially insecure activities, such as allowing a ﬁ le upload or changing 

system limits.

 ■ Listen on any port it likes for incoming requests.

On a system constrained by SELinux, the httpd daemon is much more tightly controlled.
