Likewise, any directory the httpd daemon 
must traverse to get to the content must have execute permission on for the apache user, 
apache group, or other user.

Although you cannot log in as the apache user (/sbin/nologin is the default shell), 
you can create content as root and change its ownership (chown command) or permission 
(chmod command).
