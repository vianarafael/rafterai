You can add extra aliases by using more ServerAlias 
directives or by adding extra hostnames to a single ServerAlias separated by spaces.

As we have said, the DocumentRoot directive specifies the directory from which this virtual host will 
serve files. Once this is defined, you can use the Directory directive to specify options for this directory 
and all files and directories it contains.
