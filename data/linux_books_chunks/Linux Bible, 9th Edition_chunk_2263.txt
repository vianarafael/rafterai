Also, if you change a port the service is listening on, and SELinux is in enforcing 
mode, SELinux may prevent the daemon from listening on that port (see Chapter 24, 
“Enhancing Linux Security with SELinux,” for more information on SELinux).

One reason for changing port numbers on a service is “security by obscurity.” For example, the sshd service is a 
well-known target for people trying to break into a system by guessing logins and passwords on TCP port 22.

I have heard of people changing their Internet-facing sshd service to listen on some other port number (perhaps 
some unused, very high port number).
