to do this is with the tail command using the -f option, which monitors files in real time and scrolls down

$ sudo tail â€“f /var/log/maillog

When Postfix is started successfully, you should see the following log messages:

Jul 10 03:21:34 au-mel-centos-1 postfix/postfix-script[4500]: starting the Postfix mail 
system
Jul 10 03:21:34 au-mel-centos-1 postfix/master[4502]: daemon started -- version 2.10.1, 
configuration /etc/postfix

Understanding Postfix Configuration
The majority of Postfix configuration is handled by two files, located in the /etc/postfix directory.
