platter, head, track, cylinder, sector

Data is commonly stored on magnetic or optical disk platters. The platters are rotated (at
high speeds). Data is read by heads, which are very close to the surface of the platter, without
touching it! The heads are mounted on an arm (sometimes called a comb or a fork).

Data is written in concentric circles called tracks.
