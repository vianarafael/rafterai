Since it is a number, we can use the native Logstash 
NUMBER pattern to match it.

The SEMANTIC is just the identifier we will give it so that we add greater value to our metadata labels. We 

will give it audit_epoch.

As we have said, there are two parts to the timestamp audit(1480844911.323:1080): the time and 
the unique identifier.
