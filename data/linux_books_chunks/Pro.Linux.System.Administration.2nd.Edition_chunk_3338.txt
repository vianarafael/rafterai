This means your e-mail server can check a variety of back-end services to validate that the user is 
allowed to send e-mail without needing to understand how to authenticate to those services.

These back-end services can include PAM (which can be used to allow users to authenticate with their 

Linux login and password), databases of users and passwords, and even user repositories like LDAP or 
Active Directory.
