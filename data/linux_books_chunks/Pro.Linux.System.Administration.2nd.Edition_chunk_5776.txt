We can declare other key values like become and gather_facts, 
which are Boolean values that can be true or false.

The gather_facts option will trigger an initial request to all the target hosts and gather all their 

available facts. If you are not using any facts in your plays, you can set this to false, and it will speed up your 
runs.
