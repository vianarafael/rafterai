We give the command the IP address of the host, 192.168.0.2, 
which is the router on our network for the destination network.

Now that Host D has the pathway to get to the 192.168.10.0/24 network, we should be able to ping Host 

F, right?

$ ping 192.168.10.100
PING 192.168.10.100 (192.168.10.100) 56(84) bytes of data.

It appears packets are not being returned, we see no output from that command.
