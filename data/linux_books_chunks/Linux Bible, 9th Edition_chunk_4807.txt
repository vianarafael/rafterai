What if, instead of blocking Host-B’s IP address entirely, 
only connections to the ssh port (port 22) from Host-B’s IP address were blocked? Would 
that reach the goal of allowing Host-C full access to Host-A, and only blocking ssh 
 connections from Host-B?

In the example that follows, the iptables rules for Host-A are modiﬁ ed to try  blocking 
Host-B’s IP address from port 22.
