To Ô¨Å nd commands you type, the 
shell looks in what is referred to as your path. For commands that are not in your path, you 
can type the complete identity of the location of the command.

If you know the directory that contains the command you want to run, one way to run it 
is to type the full, or absolute, path to that command.
