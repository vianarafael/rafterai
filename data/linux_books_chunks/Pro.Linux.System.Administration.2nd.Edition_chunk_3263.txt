if we wanted to redirect the 
mail for the root user to both ataylor and jsmith, we would do the following:

root: ataylor,jsmith

Now when root receives an e-mail, both ataylor and jsmith receive the same e-mail.

after making any change to the /etc/aliases file, you need to run a command called newaliases to 
update postfix with the changes.

$ sudo newaliases

We are going to look deeper into how this works in the “postfix lookup tables and virtual Domains” 
section coming up.
