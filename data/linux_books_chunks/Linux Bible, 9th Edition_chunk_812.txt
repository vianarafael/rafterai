Here are some useful metacharacters for matching ﬁ lenames:

 ■ *—Matches any number of characters.

 ■ ?—Matches any one character.

 ■ [...]—Matches any one of the characters between the brackets, which can 

include a hyphen-separated range of letters or numbers.

Try out some of these ﬁ le-matching metacharacters by ﬁ rst going to an empty directory (such 
as the test directory described in the previous section) and creating some empty ﬁ les:

$ touch apple banana grape grapefruit watermelon

The touch command creates empty ﬁ les.
