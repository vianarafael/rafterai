You may already have these packages installed, in which case YUM will 
skip them.

 â–  Note 

 We talk about DhCp in Chapter 10 and apache in Chapter 11.

Once everything is installed, we need to enable cobblerd, the daemon process, at boot and start it.

$ sudo systemctl enable cobblerd httpd
$ sudo systemctl start cobblerd
$ sudo systemctl start httpd

Cobbler requires access to the Apache server to be started.
