Instead of drive letters (for example, A:, B:, C:) for each local disk, network fi lesystem, CD-ROM, or 
other type of storage medium, everything fi ts neatly into the Linux directory structure.

Some drives are connected (mounted) automatically into the fi lesystem when you insert removable 
media. For example, a CD might be mounted on /media/cdrom.
