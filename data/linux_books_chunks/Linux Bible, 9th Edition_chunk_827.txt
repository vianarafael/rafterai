For example, if you want to 
 create a set of ﬁ les such as memo1 through memo5, you can do that as follows:

$ touch memo{1,2,3,4,5}
$ ls
memo1 memo2 memo3 memo4 memo5

The items that are expanded don’t have to be numbers or even single digits. For example, 
you could use ranges of numbers or digits. You could also use any string of characters, as 
long as you separate them with commas.
