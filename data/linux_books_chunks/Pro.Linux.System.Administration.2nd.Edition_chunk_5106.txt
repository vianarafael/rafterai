Each priority selector applies to the priority stated and all higher priorities, so mail.
err indicates all mail facility messages of err, crit, alert, and emerg priorities.

Like with facilities, you can use the wildcard selectors * and none. Additionally, you can use two other 

modifiers: = and !.
