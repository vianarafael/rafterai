Consider the following example:

# chkconfig --list cups
cups            0:off  1:off  2:off  3:off  4:off  5:off  6:off

On this Linux server, the cups service is not started at any runlevel, as shown with the 
chkconfig command. You can also check and see if any start (S) symbol links are set up 
in each of the seven runlevel directories, /etc/rc.d/rc?.d.
