Because a regular ﬁ le is created without execute permission, the effective permission is 
reduced to rw-:

[mary@cnegus ~]$ touch /tmp/mary/file.txt
[mary@cnegus ~]$ getfacl /tmp/mary/file.txt
# file: tmp/mary/file.txt
# owner: mary
# group: mary
user::rw-
group::rwx         #effective:rw-
group:sales:rwx    #effective:rw-
group:market:rwx   #effective:rw-
mask::rw-
other::r--

Enabling ACLs
Basic Linux ﬁ lesystems that you create after installation have only one user and one group 
assigned to each ﬁ le and directory and do not include ACL support by default.
