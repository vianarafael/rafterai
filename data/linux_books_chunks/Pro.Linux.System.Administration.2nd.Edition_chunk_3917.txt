This allows rsync to 
make a comparison of the files being copied and then copy only those that are different, making rsync very 
efficient when it sends data between hosts. It will also check the files being copied and copy only the portion 
of the data that is different in the file. For example, if a 1MB text file contains 990KB of the same data, rsync 
will copy only the 10KB that is different.
