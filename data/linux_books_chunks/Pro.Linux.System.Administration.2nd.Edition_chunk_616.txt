The third and last 
command uses the -R switch to enable recursion. The command would change the owner of every file and 
directory in the /home/jsmith directory to jsmith and the group to admin.

 â–  Note 
 also available is the chgrp command. It allows users to change the group of a file they own. The 
user can only change the group ownership to a group of which that user is a member.
