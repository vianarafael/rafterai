xinetd superdaemon

The xinetd daemon is often called a superdaemon because it listens to a lot of incoming
connections, and starts other daemons when they are needed. When a connection request
is received, xinetd will first check TCP wrappers (/etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny) and
then give control of the connection to the other daemon.
