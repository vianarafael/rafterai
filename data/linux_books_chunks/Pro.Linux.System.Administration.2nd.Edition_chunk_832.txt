Users could access the host through 

other authentication mechanisms such as public keys for remote access using SSH (Secure Shell).

There is another way to totally disable access to the user that uses the usermod command with the 

--expiredate option:

$ sudo usermod --expiredate 1 ataylor

This sets the account expiration date to January 1, 1970, and disables the account immediately.
