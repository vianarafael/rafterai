The GNOME 3 desktop (now used in Fedora and 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7) is a modern, elegant desktop, designed to match the types of 
interfaces available on many of todayâ€™s mobile devices. The GNOME 2 desktop (used through 
RHEL 6) provides a more traditional desktop experience.

Besides GNOME desktops, you can try out other popular and useful desktop environments.
