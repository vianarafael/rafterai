We can define the minimum security 
strength we allow for our connections and specify higher-security-strength communications for more 
sensitive roles.

For example, if we had a sec.ldif file like that shown next, it describes the factors of security we require 

for certain connection types:

dn: cn=config
changetype: modify
add: olcSecurity
olcSecurity: ssf=128 update_ssf=256 simple_bind=128 tls=256

The ssf=128 setting describes the overall security strength factor we require for our service based on 

the encryption key size.
