Xen has been around longer than KVM and is 
supported in products from Citrix Systems and Oracle.

Later in this chapter, I describe how to check to see if a computer has the hardware 
 features to be used as a hypervisor and how to conﬁ gure it to be used with KVM.

Cloud controllers
Because a cloud conﬁ guration can include multiple hypervisors, pools of storage, multiple 
virtual networks, and many virtual machines, you need centralized tools to manage 
and monitor those features.
