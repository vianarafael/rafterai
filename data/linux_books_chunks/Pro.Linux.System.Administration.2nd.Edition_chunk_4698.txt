Assume we 
have the following entries in a new users.ldif file, and we want to delete them.

uid=jbob,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com uid=tbird,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com

We can now add these two entries to a file called deluser.ldif and then run the ldapdelete command 

with the -f argument as follows:

ldapdelete -xvW -D uid=ataylor,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com \
-h ldap.example.com -Z -f deluser.ldif
ldap_initialize( ldap://ldap.example.com )
deleting entry "uid=jbob,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"
deleting entry "uid=tbird,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"

As a result, these entries are no longer in our directory and have been deleted.
