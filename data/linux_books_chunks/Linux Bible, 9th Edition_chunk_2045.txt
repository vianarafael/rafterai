If the drive isnâ€™t mounted automati-
cally, it is up to an administrator to create a mount point in the fi lesystem and then connect the disk 
to that point.

Linux can understand VFAT fi lesystems, which are often the default format when you buy a USB fl ash 
drive. A VFAT USB fl ash drive provides a good way to share data between Linux and Windows systems.
