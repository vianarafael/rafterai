But what if you wanted to mirror two directories, 
making the contents of two directory structures exactly the same on two machines? The 
following commands illustrate how to create an exact mirror of the directory structure on 
both machines, using the directories shown with the previous rsync commands.

First, on the remote system, copy a new ﬁ le into the directory being copied:

# cp /etc/services /usr/share/man/man1

Next, on the local system, run rsync to copy across any new ﬁ les (in this case, just the 
directory and the new ﬁ le, services):

$ rsync -avl johndoe@10.140.67.23:/usr/share/man/man1 /tmp
johndoe@10.140.67.23's password:
***************
sending incremental file list
man1/
man1/services

After that, go back to the remote system and remove the new ﬁ le:

$ sudo rm /usr/share/man/man1/services

Now, on the local system, run rsync again and notice that nothing happens.
