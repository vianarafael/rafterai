For example, enabling the FTP 
 service also causes connection tracking modules to be loaded that allow nonstandard ports 
to be accessed through the Ô¨Å rewall when needed.

As mentioned earlier, underlying the firewalld service is the iptables facility. If you 
have a Linux system without the firewalld service (or with firewalld disabled), 
you can still use the iptables service.
