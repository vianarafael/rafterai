This 
alias is usually used as a longer description of the host and is also available as a macro called $HOSTALIAS$.
The last attribute, address, provides the IP address of the host; in this case weâ€™re monitoring our local 

host, 127.0.0.1. This IP address must be contactable by Nagios to allow monitoring to take place.
