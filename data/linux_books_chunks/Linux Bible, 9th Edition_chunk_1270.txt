You must remember and protect this password; you need it to log in as 
root or to obtain root permission while you are logged in as some other user.

To become familiar with the root user account, you can simply log in as the root user. I 
recommend trying this from a virtual console. To do so, press Ctrl+Alt+F2. When you see 
the login prompt, type root (press Enter) and enter the password.
