Gaining expertise 
with regular expressions is quite a challenge, but after you master it, you can accomplish 
many useful things with just the simplest forms.

For example, you can display a list of all regular user accounts by using grep to search for 
all lines that contain the text /home in the /etc/passwd ﬁ le as follows:

$ grep /home /etc/passwd

7

Or you could ﬁ nd all environment variables that begin with HO using the following 
command:

$ env | grep ^HO

The ^ in the preceding code is the actual caret character, ^, not what you’ll commonly see for a backspace, ^H.
