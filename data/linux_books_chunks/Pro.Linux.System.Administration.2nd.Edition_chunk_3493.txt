Some additional packages may also be 

installed as prerequisites of these packages.

$ sudo aptitude install clamav clamav-daemon clamav-milter

Once again, the distributions put the configuration files into different locations. For CentOS we find 

clamav-milter in /etc/mail/clamav-milter.conf, and for the clamav daemon we find them in /etc/
clam.d/scan.conf.
