if you’re considering a wireless network for your business, 
we recommend you read the information at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_security, 
https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/protecting-your-wireless-network, and https://www.
communications.gov.au/what-we-do/internet/stay-smart-online/computers/secure-your-internet-
connection.

We’re going to start by explaining how to configure networking on a single host and introduce you to the 

tools and commands you will need to configure a broader network.

In order to show you how to configure a network, we’re going to use an example network that we have 

created.
