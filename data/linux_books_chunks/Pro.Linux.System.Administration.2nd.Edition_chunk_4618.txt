We have used the scope of 
subtree, and there is minimal write access granted to everything except the cn=admins group.

to dn.children="ou=hosts,dc=example.com"
        by group.exact="cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com" write
        by anonymous read

Here the cn=admins group will require write access.
