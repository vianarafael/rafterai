daemon or demon ?

A daemon is a process that runs in background, without a link to a GUI or terminal. Daemons
are usually started at system boot, and stay alive until the system shuts down. In more recent
technical writings, daemons are often refered to as services.

Unix daemons are not to be confused with demons.
