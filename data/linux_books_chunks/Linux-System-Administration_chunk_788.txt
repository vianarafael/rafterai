login logging

To keep track of who is logging into the system, Linux can maintain the /var/log/wtmp, /
var/log/btmp, /var/run/utmp and /var/log/lastlog files.

17.1.1. /var/run/utmp (who)

Use the who command to see the /var/run/utmp file. This command is showing you all the
currently logged in users.
