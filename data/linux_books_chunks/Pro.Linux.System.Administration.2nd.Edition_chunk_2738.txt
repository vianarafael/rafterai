We can define the key type (two 
encryption algorithms are supported) and key size in bits, as well as the output file names to use. For the 
latter we’ll use the defaults, and for the former we’ll specify the RSA algorithm with the -t option and a 4096-
bit key using the -b option, as shown in Listing 10-33.
