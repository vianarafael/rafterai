caching only server without forwarder

A caching only server without forwarder will have to get information elsewhere. When it
receives a query from a client, then it will consult one of the root servers. The root server
will refer it to a tld server, which will refer it to another dns server. That last server might
know the answer to the query, or may refer to yet another server.
