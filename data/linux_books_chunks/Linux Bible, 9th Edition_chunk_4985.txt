Create a ﬁ le named user-data to hold 
data that conﬁ gures inside the operating system on the image itself. For this 
simple case, I just set a password for the default user (fedora) to cloudpass and 
 cloud-init not to expire the password:

#cloud-config
password: cloudpass
chpasswd: {expire: False}

3.  Combine the data into a separate image.
