The *:80 means that requests to port 80 on any IP address will be treated in 
this manner.

 ■ Similarly, the *:80 speciﬁ cation in the VirtualHost block indicates what 

address and port this virtual host applies to. With multiple IP addresses associ-
ated with your Linux system, the * can be replaced by a speciﬁ c IP address.
