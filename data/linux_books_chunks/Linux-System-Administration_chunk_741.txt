Test the script!

The script could look something like this.

#!/bin/bash
#
# chkconfig: 345 99 01 
# description: pold demo script
#
# /etc/init.d/pold

190

 
 
 
 
init and runlevels

#

case "$1" in
  start)
     echo -n "Starting pold..."
     sleep 1;
     touch /var/lock/subsys/pold
     echo "done."
     echo pold started >> /var/log/messages
     ;;
  stop)
     echo -n "Stopping pold..."
     sleep 1;
     rm -rf /var/lock/subsys/pold
     echo "done."
     echo pold stopped >> /var/log/messages
     ;;
  *)
     echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/pold {start|stop}"
     exit 1
     ;;
esac
exit 0

The touch /var/lock/subsys/pold is mandatory and must be the same filename as the script
name, if you want the stop sequence (the K01pold link) to be run.
