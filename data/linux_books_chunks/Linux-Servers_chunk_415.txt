old DNS notify

The original design of DNS in rfc 1034 and rfc 1035 implemented a refresh time in the
SOA record to configure a time loop for slaves to query their master server. This can result
in a lot of useless pull requests, or in a significant lag between updates.

For  this  reason  dns  notify  (rfc  1996)  was  designed.  The  server  will  now  notify  slaves
whenever there is an update.
