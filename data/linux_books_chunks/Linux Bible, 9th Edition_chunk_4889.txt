To check the memory and swap on the computer, I typed the following:

# free -m
         total    used     free   shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:      7867    3433     2835      298        1598        3860
Swap:    12287       0    12287

This system has about 8GB of RAM and 12GB of swap. I estimate that 4GB is good for a 
desktop system.
