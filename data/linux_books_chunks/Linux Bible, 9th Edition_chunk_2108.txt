What happens if you run out of disk 
space? In the old days, a common solution was to copy data to a bigger disk, restart the 
system with the new disk, and hope that you didn’t run out of space again any time soon. 
This process meant downtime and inefﬁ ciency.

Logical volume management (LVM) offers lots of ﬂ exibility and efﬁ ciency in dealing with 
constantly changing storage needs.
