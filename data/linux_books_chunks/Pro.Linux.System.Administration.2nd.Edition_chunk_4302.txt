OpenVPN Firewall Rules CentOS

$ sudo firewall-cmd --zone public --permanent --add-port=1194/udp && sudo firewall-cmd 
--reload

Here we’ve added a rule allowing incoming UDP traffic to the tun0 interface on port 1194.
Or, if you are using TCP instead, you use a rule like the following:

$ sudo firewall-cmd --zone public --permanent --add-port=1194/tcp && sudo firewall-cmd –
reload

706

And of course for Ubuntu that would be as follows:

$ sudo ufw allow 1194/udp
