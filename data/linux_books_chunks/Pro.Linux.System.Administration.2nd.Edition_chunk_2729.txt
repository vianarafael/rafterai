If you simply change the zone file, these changes will be ignored because the data 
in the journal file will supersede it.

You can tell the DNS server you want to lock the zone journal files and reject any dynamic changes 
while youâ€™re editing a zone by issuing the sudo rndc freeze command before you start editing.
