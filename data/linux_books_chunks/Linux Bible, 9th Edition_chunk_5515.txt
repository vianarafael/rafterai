The resulting work is 
called a “modiﬁ ed version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

A “covered work” means either the unmodiﬁ ed Program or a work based on the Program.

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make 
you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except 
executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.
