However only the modules that have 
been compiled will be stored here.

Types of Kernel Images

The various kernel image types differ depending only on the type of compression used to 
compress the kernel.

The make tool will read the /usr/src/linux/Makefile to compile  

• A compressed linux kernel using gzip is compiled with: make zImage
The compiled kernel will be:

/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/zImage

The Linux Kernel

_____________________________________________________

• A compressed linux kernel using better compression is compiled with: make bzImage
The compiled image will be:

/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage

• One can also use: make zdisk or make bzdisk to create compressed kernels on 

a floppy.
