With few exceptions, such as 
Microsoft Windows, most modern computer systems (including Mac OS X and Linux) were 
derived from UNIX operating systems, created originally by AT&T.

To truly appreciate how a free operating system could have been modeled after a 
 proprietary system from AT&T Bell Laboratories, it helps to understand the culture in 
which UNIX was created and the chain of events that made the essence of UNIX possible 
to reproduce freely.

To learn more about how Linux was created, pick up the book Just for Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary 
by Linus Torvalds (HarperCollins Publishing, 2001).

From the very beginning, the UNIX operating system was created and nurtured in a 
 communal environment.
