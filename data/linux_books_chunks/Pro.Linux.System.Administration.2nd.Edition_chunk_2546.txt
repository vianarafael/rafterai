Running Caching DNS
Not all ISPs’ name servers are equally reliable, and some can be slow, so why don’t we run our own? A few 
DNS server software packages are available, but the most commonly used and well-known is Berkeley 
Internet Name Domain (BIND).

 ■ Note  BInD is named after the place where it was developed, the university of California at Berkeley.

The software is provided by the bind package on CentOS.
