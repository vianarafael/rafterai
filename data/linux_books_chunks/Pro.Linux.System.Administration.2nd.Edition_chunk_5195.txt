We will not start our Filebeat service straightaway, but you can start and stop it using systemctl as you 

would normally.

$ sudo systemctl enable filebeat
$ sudo systemctl start filebeat

Before we start our Filebeat service, we will configure our Logstash service to accept the logs.

Installing and Configuring Logstash

Logstash is a Java process that is used to transform data prior to “stashing” the output in some kind of 
storage for further analysis or viewing.
