Basic server room physical security includes items such as these:

 ■ A lock or security alarm on the server room door

 ■ Access controls that allow only authorized access and identify who accessed the 

room and when the access occurred, such as a card key entry system

 ■ A sign stating “no unauthorized access allowed” on the door

 ■ Policies on who can access the room and when access may occur, for groups such as 

the cleaning crew, server administrators, and others

Physical security includes environmental controls.
