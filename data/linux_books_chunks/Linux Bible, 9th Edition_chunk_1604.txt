Here are some issues 
to consider:

 ■ Do you want to install another operating system? If you want Windows on your 

computer along with Linux, you need at least one Windows (Win95, FAT16, VFAT, or 
NTFS type), one Linux (Linux ext4 or xfs), and usually one Linux swap partition.

 ■ Is it a multiuser system? If you are using the system yourself, you probably don’t 
need many partitions.
