We can now mount the share on the local 

server with the following command:

$ sudo mount -tcifs //dc1.samba.example.com/sales /data/sales/ -o 
multiuser,username=sharedcreds, \
uid=exbackup,gid=3000017

This mounts the /data/sales share using the sharedcreds user. But because there is no local 

sharedcreds user, we donâ€™t have access to write into /data/sales.
