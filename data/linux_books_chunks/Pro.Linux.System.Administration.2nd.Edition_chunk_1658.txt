For the rules in our IPV4-INCOMING chain to be parsed, we need to add a rule in the INPUT chain that 
directs all the incoming packets to our host to the IPV4-INCOMING chain.

$ sudo /sbin/iptables –t filter –A INPUT –j IPV4-INCOMING
num target     prot opt source      destination
1  IPV4-INCOMING all --  anywhere     anywhere

We have included the output of the list (–L) command above.
