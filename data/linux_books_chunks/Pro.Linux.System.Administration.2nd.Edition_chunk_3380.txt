We submit the username, and then we are asked for the password 
(334 UGFzc3dvcmQ6). We submit the password, all in base64 encoding. The authentication succeeded, and 
the test e-mail was submitted. If the authentication mechanism had failed, Postfix would have kept trying 
authentication mechanisms, in our case LOGIN and then PLAIN, until one mechanism succeeds or all have 
failed.
