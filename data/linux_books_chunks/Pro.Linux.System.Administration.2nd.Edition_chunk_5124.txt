RELP allows you to relay logs from clients to servers 
that can push logs onto other servers. We will use TLS to encrypt our log traffic and avoid rouge clients from 
connecting and potentially sending bogus log traffic or staging DoS attacks, which is possible with the plain 
UDP/TCP modules.

On Ubuntu the syslog user runs the rsyslogd service.
