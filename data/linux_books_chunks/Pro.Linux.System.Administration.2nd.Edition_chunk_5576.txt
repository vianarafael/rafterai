For group packages, you can use tasksel 
(or task select owner) to multiselect a package group—like ubuntu-desktop.

tasksel tasksel/first multiselect ubuntu-desktop

For individual packages, you can just use the following:

d-i pkgsel/include string openssh-server

You can have more than one package selected if you like.

d-i pkgsel/include string openssh-server build-essential
