This is done by tagging network packets to identify the cgroup task that 
originated the packet and having the Linux trafﬁ c controller monitor and restrict 
packets coming from each cgroup.

 ■ Network traffic (net_prio)—Sets priorities of network trafﬁ c coming from 

selected cgroups and lets administrators change these priorities on the ﬂ y.

 ■ Name spaces (ns)—Separates cgroups into namespaces, so processes in one 

cgroup can only see the namespaces associated with the cgroup.
