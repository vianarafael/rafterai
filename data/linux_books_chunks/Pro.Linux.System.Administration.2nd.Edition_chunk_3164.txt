They then send the e-mail.

The user’s e-mail client is configured with a server, and your client now contacts this server (on TCP port 
25) and says “Hello! I have mail from this person to these people—please send it to them!” Actually, our client 
doesn’t precisely say “hello,” it says something pretty close—a command called EHLO (or more rarely HELO).

 there are a lot of names for e-mail servers.
