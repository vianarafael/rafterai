Because I am on the local 
system in this example, I just use the name localhost and the user I added (chris):

# smbclient -U chris //localhost/salesdata
Enter chris's password: ********
Domain=[DATAGROUP] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 4.1.15]
smb: \> lcd /etc
smb: \> put hosts
putting file hosts as \hosts (43.5 kb/s) (average 43.5 kb/s)
smb: \> ls
  .
