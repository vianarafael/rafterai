You can see cloud_config_modules that set the locale, set the time zone, and 
run further conÔ¨Å guration tools (such as chef and puppet).

Because yum repositories are enabled, provided you have an available network connection 
(DHCP should have assigned addresses to the virtual machine by default), you can install 
any packages available from the Fedora repositories.

Cloning the cloud instance
If you decide you like the cloud instance you created, you can save a copy of it to run 
later by making a clone of the two images (cloud and data image) that make up the cloud 
instance.
