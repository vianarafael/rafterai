However, most Linux shell 
users use either the vi or emacs command to edit text ﬁ les.

The advantage of vi or emacs over a graphical editor is that you can use the command 
from any shell, character terminal, or character-based connection over a network (using 
telnet or ssh, for example)—no graphical interface is required.
