You could start by using the search subcommand to look for the term 
“editor” in the name or description:

# yum search editor
...
eclipse-veditor.noarch : Eclipse-based Verilog/VHDL plugin
ed.x86_64 : The GNU line editor
emacs.x86_64 : GNU Emacs text editor

The search uncovered a long list of packages containing “editor” in the name or  description. 
The one I was looking for is named emacs.
