In the Release you can see the first of the 

macros, %{?dist}. This adds the distribution details to the package. The Summary, License, Source, and 
URL are required information. You can have more than one source file if required and we have used macros 
again to describe itâ€”it can be a URL or must exist in the SOURCES directory.

BuildRequires and Requires are for handling package dependencies.
