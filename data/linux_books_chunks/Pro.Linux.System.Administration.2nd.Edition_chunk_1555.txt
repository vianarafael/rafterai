Rules are the basic Netfilter configuration items that contain 
criteria to match particular traffic and perform an action on the matched traffic.

Traffic that is currently being processed by the host is compared against these rules, and if the current 

packet being processed satisfies the selection criteria of a rule, the action, known as a target, specified by 
that rule is carried out.
