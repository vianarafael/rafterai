The configuration for the catalog 
will begin with the Catalog definition.

Catalog {
  Name = MyCatalog
  # Uncomment the following lines if you want the dbi driver
  # dbdriver = "dbi:postgresql"; dbaddress = 127.0.0.1; dbport =
  #dbdriver = "postgresql"
  dbdriver = "mysql"
  dbname = "bareos"
  dbuser = "bareos"
  dbpassword = "somepassword"
  dbaddress = headoffice.example.com
}

The Name can be anything, and we will stick with the default MyCatalog.
