The  use  of  logical  volumes  is  similar  to  the  use  of  partitions  and  is
accomplished with the same standard commands (mkfs, mount, fsck, df, ...).

The commands used to manage a logical volume start with lv.

[root@centos65 ~]# lv
lvchange     lvextend     lvmdiskscan  lvmsar       lvresize     
lvconvert    lvm          lvmdump      lvreduce     lvs          
lvcreate     lvmchange    lvmetad      lvremove     lvscan       
lvdisplay    lvmconf      lvmsadc      lvrename
