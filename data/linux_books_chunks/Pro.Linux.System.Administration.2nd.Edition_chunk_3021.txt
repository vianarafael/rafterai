Like 
driver’s licenses, certificates have an expiry period and are valid only for a fixed period, usually 12 months.

Each digital certificate can also contain a reference to a certificate authority. A CA is a mechanism that 
issues certificates and has a special certificate called a root certificate that is then used to validate the server 
certificate’s veracity.
