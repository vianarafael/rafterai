if you want to change the duplex mode and 
speed, you would issue a command like the following:

$ sudo ethtool -s enp0s8 speed 1000 duplex half

Here we have changed the speed of the ethernet card to 1000Mb/s and the duplex setting to half 
duplex. You can use other settings as well. For a greater understanding of the available settings, please 
read the man page for ethtool.
