The PS1 environment variable sets what the prompt contains and is 
what you interact with most of the time. If your shell requires additional input, it uses the 
values of PS2, PS3, and PS4.

When your Linux system is installed, often a prompt is set to contain more than just a 
dollar sign or pound sign.
