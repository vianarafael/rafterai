You can do this on CentOS with $ sudo 

systemctl restart php-fpm. You should now notice a socket file has been created in the /run directory 
(which is a special in-memory directory).

$ ll /run/php-fcgi.sock
srw-rw-rw-. 1 root root 0 Aug 16 09:49 /run/php-fcgi.sock

Once that is done, we are ready to run PHP web sites.
