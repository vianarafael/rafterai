To enable the non-free repository in Fedora, type the  following 
(again, type the following two lines on a single line, with no space between the two):

# rpm -Uhv http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/
rpmfusion-nonfree-release-stable.noarch.rpm

Most of the other third-party repositories that might interest you contain software that 
is not open source.
