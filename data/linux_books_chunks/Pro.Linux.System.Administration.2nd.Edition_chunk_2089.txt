one of the four available physical 
partitions is marked as an extended partition, which then functions as a container for an unlimited 
number of logical partitions.

the 16 bytes describes every partition, include information about the partition type, where on the disk it 
can be found, and whether it is bootable, though Linux doesnâ€™t care about the latter.

you would use the fdisk utitility to manage MBr disks.

With gpt we have previously said that we can partition disks up to 2ZiB.
