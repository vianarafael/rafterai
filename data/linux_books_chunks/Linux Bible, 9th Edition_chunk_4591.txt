The partial display that follows shows roles mapped to SELinux 
usernames:

# semanage user -l
             Labeling MLS/      MLS/             
SELinux User Prefix   MCS Level MCS Range       SELinux Roles
guest_u      user     s0        s0              guest_r
...
user_u       user     s0        s0              user_r
xguest_u     user     s0        s0              xguest_r

If you need to add a new SELinux username, the semanage utility is used again.
