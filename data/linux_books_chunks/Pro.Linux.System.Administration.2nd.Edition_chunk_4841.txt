The up and down arrows navigate to the different fields. If you press s, you will see that 
that field is now selected. The d key and spacebar toggle whether that field will be displayed. You can use q 
or the Escape key to go back to the top screen with your selection. We can press s to make the %CPU column 
our sort field and then press q to go back to the task list.
