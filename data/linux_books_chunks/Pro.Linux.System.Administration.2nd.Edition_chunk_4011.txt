Remember we talked about the S3 tiers 
earlier? We back up originally to the Standard tier. The next below that is Standard Infrequently Accessed 
(Standard-IA) and then below that is the Glacier storage. The Standard tier costs the most, so we want to 
transition off that as soon as possible, and we have chosen 35 days.
