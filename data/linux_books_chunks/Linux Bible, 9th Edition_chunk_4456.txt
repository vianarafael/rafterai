However, the /etc/pam.d/
passwd includes the system-auth ﬁ le in its stack.

# cat /etc/pam.d/passwd
#%PAM-1.0
auth       include     system-auth
account    include     system-auth
password   substack    system-auth
-password  optional    pam_gnome_keyring.so use_authtok
password   substack    postlogin

On Ubuntu, you need to modify the /etc/pam.d/common-password fi le, instead of the system-auth con-
fi guration fi le.

The current settings of the system-auth ﬁ le are shown here.
