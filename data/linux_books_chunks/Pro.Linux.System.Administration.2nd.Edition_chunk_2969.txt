This 
amount is controlled by the innodb_buffer_pool_size variable, and weâ€™ve set it to 128Mb. This should be a 
reasonable amount on a modern server that runs MariaDB as well as other services. On a dedicated server it 
can be set to up to 80 percent of the available memory.

We can tell the server not to cache any data in the operating system disk cache by setting innodb_

flush_method.
