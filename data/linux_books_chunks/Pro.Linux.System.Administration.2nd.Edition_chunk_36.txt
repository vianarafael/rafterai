CentOS
CentOS (www.centos.org/) is a derivation of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux platform. Based on the same 
source code, it is available at no charge (and without Red Hatâ€™s support). People who wish to make use of 
the Red Hat platform and its stability without paying for additional support commonly use it.
