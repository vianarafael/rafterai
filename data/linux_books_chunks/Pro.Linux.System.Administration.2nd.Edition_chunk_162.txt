The Linux kernel uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) 
as its clock source but you can set your appropriate time zone here. You might also consider setting all your 
servers to UTC rather than a local time zone.

WHY SET ALL YOUR SERVERS TO UTC?

Consider you are building the infrastructure for a brand-new application.
