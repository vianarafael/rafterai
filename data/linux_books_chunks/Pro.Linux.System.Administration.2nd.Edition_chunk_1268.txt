You can configure it manually, 

 â–  Note 
allowing it to request a random iP in a pool of addresses, and allowing it to request an assigned iP address that 
it is guaranteed to get. For important iP addresses like network gateways you should always manually configure 
it or make sure they always receive a known guaranteed address.
