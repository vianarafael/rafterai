Another of Upstart’s major improvements over System V init is 
that it can start services by reacting when certain events occur (such as when a piece of 
hardware is connected).

If you are using a Linux system the employs Upstart, you should know a few things about 
it. The ﬁ rst process that starts on an Upstart system is still called the init process, but it 
is actually an Upstart daemon.
