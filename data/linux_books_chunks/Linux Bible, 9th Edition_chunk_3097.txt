For httpd in 

SELinux, there are different ﬁ le contexts for content, conﬁ guration ﬁ les, log ﬁ les, 
scripts, and other httpd-related ﬁ les. Any ﬁ le that is not set to the proper context 
is not accessible to the httpd daemon.

 ■ Prevent insecure features from being used, such as ﬁ le uploading and clear-text 

authentication, by setting Booleans for such features to the off position.
