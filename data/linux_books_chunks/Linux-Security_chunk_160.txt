At the next login, harry will default into ksh instead of bash.

[laura@centos7 ~]$ chsh -l
/bin/sh
/bin/bash
/sbin/nologin
/usr/bin/sh
/usr/bin/bash
/usr/sbin/nologin
/bin/ksh
/bin/tcsh
/bin/csh
[laura@centos7 ~]$

Note that the -l option does not exist on Debian and that the above screenshot assumes that
ksh and csh shells are installed.

The screenshot below shows how laura can change her default shell (active on next login).

[laura@centos7 ~]$ chsh -s /bin/ksh
