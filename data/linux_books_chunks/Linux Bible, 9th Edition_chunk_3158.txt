The port is optional for both NameVirtualHost and VirtualHost speciﬁ ca-
tions but should always be used to prevent interference with SSL virtual hosts 
(which use port 443 by default).

 ■ The ServerName and ServerAlias lines tell Apache which names this 

 virtual host should be recognized as, so replace them with names appropriate 
to your site.
