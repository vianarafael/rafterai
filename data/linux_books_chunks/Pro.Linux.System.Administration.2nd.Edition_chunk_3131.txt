The third does the same 
but for traffic to the local network interface.

Let’s add in some ACLs for our network addresses. We can add these directly under the line that defines 

to_localhost.

acl wired src 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0
acl wireless src 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0

We’ve defined two new ACLs, one for the wired network range and one for the wireless range.
