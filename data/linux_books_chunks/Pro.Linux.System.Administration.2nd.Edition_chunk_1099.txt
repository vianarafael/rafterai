Requires does not 
provide ordering but tells systemd that these services should be executed too. If one of the required targets 
or services fails, this unit will be deactivated too.

Ordering support of targets or services is provided by adding options like the After. The rescue.unit 
should now be started after sysinit.target and rescue.service.
