It is easier to treat all your hosts as production and handle the different roles and 
profiles these hosts may take on in the Puppet manifest itself. It often leads to a horrible divergence of your 
Puppet code between systems and VCS branches. By all means create an environment to test your Puppet 
code, but roll that as soon as you can into the production branch.
