The syntax of the LDAP tool commands usually looks like this:

ldaptool <options> filter entry

Several LDAP tools are available. The main ones are ldapadd, ldapmodify, ldapsearch, and 

ldapdelete, and as we said, they all share some or all of the common options shown previously. For the 
exact options available, please refer to the man pages for those tools.
