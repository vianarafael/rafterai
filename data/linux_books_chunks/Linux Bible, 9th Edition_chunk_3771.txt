The Setup screen tells you the type of system, its BIOS version, its processors, its 
memory slots and types, whether it is 32-bit or 64-bit, which devices are in each 
slot, and many details about the types of devices attached to the system.

If you can’t get an operating system booted at all, the BIOS Setup screen may be 
the only way to determine the system model, processor type, and other information 
you need to search for help or call for support.

 ■ To disable/enable a device—Most devices connected to your computer are enabled 
and made available for use by the operating system.
