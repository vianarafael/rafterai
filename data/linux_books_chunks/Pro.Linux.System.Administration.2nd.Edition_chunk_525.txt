From here you can navigate the filesystem; start by changing the directory to the root directory 
using the cd, or change directory, command, as you can see in Listing 4-6.

Listing 4-6.  Changing Directories

user@host:~$ cd /
user@host:/$

If you can ignore the user@host for a moment in Listing 4-6, you can see weâ€™ve moved from our current 
directory to /, which is called the root directory.
