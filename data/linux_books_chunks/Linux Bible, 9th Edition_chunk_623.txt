The path consists of 
a list of directories that are checked sequentially for the commands you enter. To see your 
current path, type the following:

$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:â†µ
/home/chris/bin

The results show a common default path for a regular Linux user. Directories in the path 
list are separated by colons.
