If we were using a group or a regular expression to define our host, this listing would be more immediately

There is still one thing we need to do before we can run our playbook command, and this is not 
obvious. We have created our database secrets in a group vars directory called dbs, which means that the 
backup.example.com host must be a member of that host group.
