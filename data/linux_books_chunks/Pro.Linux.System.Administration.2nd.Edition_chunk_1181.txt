The 
sysinit.target has Wants=local-fs.target swap.target. I am leaving out some other detail here, like Conflicts and 
After directives, but you should be able to see that the multiuser target is made up of all these other targets 
and that is how systemd knows what target to pull in.

We have said that some of these targets define a “state” of a machine.
