You need not require recipients to 
copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the 
object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different 
server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, 
provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to Ô¨Å nd 
the Corresponding Source.
