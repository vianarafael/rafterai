If we had received no responses, we would 
know something is wrong with our interface or network.

The next step is to ping another host on your network, like your default gateway or your DNS server 

(these two hosts are critical for your Internet communications).

$ ping 192.168.0.1
PING 192.168.0.1 (192.168.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=128 time=2.97 ms

If you can get there, you know that your host can reach other hosts.
