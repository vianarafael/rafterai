Interestingly we also have an 

IPv6-generated IP address, which is based on the MAC address that is assigned.

To bring down the interface, you would use the following:

$ sudo ip link set dev enp0s8 down

You can validate what you have down by issuing the following command which provides just the link 

status:

$ sudo ip link show enp0s8
3: enp0s8: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state DOWN mode DEFAULT group 
default qlen 1000
    link/ether 08:00:27:13:3c:00 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

Letâ€™s now add an IPv4 address to our network device.
