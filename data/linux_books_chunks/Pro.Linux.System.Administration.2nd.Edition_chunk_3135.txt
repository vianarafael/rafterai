If a 
site you need to access runs on a nonstandard port, you can add the port number to the Safe_ports ACL 
and so permit browsers to connect to it.

acl Safe_ports port 80  # http
acl Safe_ports port 21     # ftp
acl Safe_ports port 443 # https

Now that we have defined all the ACLs we need, we can complete our configuration by defining access 
rules for these ACLs.
