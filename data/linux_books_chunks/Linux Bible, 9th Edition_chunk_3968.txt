Modify the rule 
or add a rule prior to your rules to make an exception for the host you want to 
allow to access your service.

If the port is now open, but the service itself is closed, check that the service itself is 
running and listening on the appropriate interfaces.

Check the service on the server
If there seems to be nothing blocking client access to your server through the actual ports 
providing the service you want to share, it is time to check the service itself.
