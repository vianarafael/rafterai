The kernel contains software that allows you to make use of your hard disk drives, network 
cards, RAM, and other hardware components. In the Linux world, the kernel is based on code originally 
developed by the founder of Linux, Finnish developer Linus Torvalds. The kernel is now maintained by a 
community of open source developers, and changes go through a software life-cycle process.
