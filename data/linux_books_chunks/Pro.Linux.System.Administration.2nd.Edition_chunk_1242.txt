As a privileged user, you can view another person’s cron by issuing the crontab command with the –u 

username option.

$ sudo crontab –u ataylor –l

You can also edit another person’s cron by issuing the same crontab command and the –u username -e 

options.

$ sudo crontab –u ataylor –e

This allows you to edit the crontab for the user.
You can also remove your crontab or another user’s crontab by issuing the crontab command with the 

–r option.

$ sudo crontab –u ataylor –r

This removes ataylor’s crontab file: /var/spool/cron/ataylor.
Your host has a service that monitors the cron jobs and any changes to them.
