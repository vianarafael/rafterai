If one end of your connection is a network device that supports connecting to 
OpenVPN, then you’ll need to install the server only on the host that you will be using as the tunnel endpoint.

We’re going to start by installing the server on our bastion host, gateway.example.com, which has the 
internal IP address of 192.168.0.254 and external IP address of 192.0.2.155, in the head office branch of our 
example network.

OpenVPN works on both CentOS and Ubuntu, and it can be installed via normal package management 

methods.
