This provides some level of security for your logs.

However, it does not stop people who attack your system from covering their tracks, and they can get 
around this by either deleting the logs or editing between the sealing time interval. It does not provide any 
extra information in the event of someone tampering with your logs but will give you a timeframe in which 
such an event happened.
