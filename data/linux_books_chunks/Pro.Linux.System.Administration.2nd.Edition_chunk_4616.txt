This setting will give the users the ability to change their own attribute details that define their 
personal information, whereas read access does not.

In the following code, we grant access to the ou=groups branch where we will hold all our group 

information.

to dn.children="ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com"
        by dn.exact="cn=webadmin,ou=meta,dc=example,dc=com" read
        by group.exact="cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com" write
        by anonymous read

As you can see, this is similar to the ou=people branch with the same administrator accounts having 

the same access.
