As mentioned 
earlier, there are three files for dealing with the Bareos server itself and one for the management console.

What we are going to do in these exercises is the following:

•	

In the bareos-dir.conf file:

•	

•	

•	

•	

•	

•	

•	

•	

•	

•	

Configure the director with the correct name

Configure the default Linux backup job definition

Configure a backup job for the headoffice server

Configure the set of files to back up

Configure the schedule of the backup

Configure the client to back up

Add the Storage daemon configuration for the Director

Configure the pools

Configure the console

Configure the messages

•	

In the bareos-sd.conf file:

•	

Configure the storage daemon

•	

In the bareos-fd.conf file:

•	

Configure the client daemon

Before we configure anything in Bareos, we should explain the relationship these files have with 
each other.
