Chains are then listed along with their default policies if they have one set. The byte and counter marks[0:0], 
can be used to see how much traffic in volume has passed through that chain as well as how many packets 
have passed through it (you can use iptables â€“Z chain to reset these counters to zero if you wish). We then 
list all our rules for that particular chain.
