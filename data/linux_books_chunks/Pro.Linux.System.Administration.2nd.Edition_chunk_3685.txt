For example, if we want to allow access to all hosts on 
our 192.168.0. network except a naughty host with the address 192.168.0.15, we would use the following in 
hosts allow:

hosts allow = 127. 192.168.0. EXCEPT 192.168.0.15

You can also use fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) like headoffice.example.com or gateway.

example.com to specify individual hosts.
