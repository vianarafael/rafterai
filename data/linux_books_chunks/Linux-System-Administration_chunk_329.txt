GUID partition table

gpt was developed because of the limitations of the 1980s mbr partitioning scheme (for
example only four partitions can be defined, and they have a maximum size two terabytes).

Since 2010 gpt is a part of the uefi specification, but it is also used on bios systems.

Newer versions of fdisk work fine with gpt, but most production servers today (mid 2015)
still have an older fdisk..
