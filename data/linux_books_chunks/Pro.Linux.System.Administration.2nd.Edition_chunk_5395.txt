For example, to monitor the load on a remote host, we could use the following command:

$ sudo vi /etc/nagios/objects/commands.cfg
# ssh_check_commands
define command{
         command_name       check_load_ssh
         command_line       $USER1$/check_by_ssh -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -l nagios  ïƒ‰
-C "/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/check_load -w $ARG1$ -c $ARG2$"
        }

We have added the previous command definition to the /etc/nagios/objects/commands.cfg file.
