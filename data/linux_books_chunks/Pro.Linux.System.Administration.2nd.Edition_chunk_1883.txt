For example, the rpm –qc <package> command will show you the 
configuration files associated with the package, the rpm –qd will list the documentation files.

Often packages will run pre- and post-install and uninstall scripts before or after they have been 
installed or uninstalled. These may create users, configure and start services, or clean up after themselves.
