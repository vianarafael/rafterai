Although there are more secure protocols for network ﬁ le sharing, FTP is still used 
quite often for making ﬁ les freely available on the Internet.

Several FTP server projects are available with Linux today. However, the one often used with 
Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, and other Linux distributions is the Very Secure FTP 
Daemon (vsftpd package).
