We will need create that 

directory and then change our bind configuration file for the local zones to be like the following:

zone "example.com" {
    type master;
    file "master/example.com.db";
    key-directory "/etc/bind/keys";
    auto-dnssec maintain;
    inline-signing yes;
};

zone "0.168.192.in-addr.arpa" {
    type master;
    file "master/192.168.0.db";
    key-directory "/etc/bind/keys";
    auto-dnssec maintain;
    inline-signing yes;
};

We use the key-directory directive to tell bind where to find the keys we are going to creating.
