They have the format:

 –A <CHAIN> -j <CHAIN TO JUMP TO>.

So line 12 says to send all packets to the INPUT_direct chain managed by Firewalld. If you looked in the 

full output of the iptables-save command you may not see any rules associated with this chain. If we can’t 
find any rules we move to the next rules in our INPUT chain. Line 13 also may not have any rules associated 
with that chain.
