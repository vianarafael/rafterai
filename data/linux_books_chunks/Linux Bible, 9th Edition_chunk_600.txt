For example, the following two uses of options for the ls command are the same:

$ ls -l -a -t
$ ls -lat

In both cases, the ls command is run with the -l (long listing), -a (show hidden dot 
Ô¨Å les), and -t options (list by time).

Some commands include options that are represented by a whole word.
