A simple e-mail server, designed to send and receive e-mail for a domain, can be set up in 
minutes.

The first step is telling Postfix what domains it should be handling mail for. To do this, we update the 
mydestination configuration option in the main.cf configuration file by adding our domain to it, in this case 
example.com.
