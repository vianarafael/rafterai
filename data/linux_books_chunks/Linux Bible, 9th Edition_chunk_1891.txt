The comment ﬁ eld was correctly set to Sara 
Green, the home directory was automatically assigned as /home/sara, and the command 
shell was assigned as /bin/tcsh, exactly as speciﬁ ed with the useradd options.

By leaving out many of the options (as I did in the ﬁ rst useradd example), defaults are 
assigned in most cases.
