If it is not on your network, your host will use 
the default gateway to reach it. Your host then will ask the DNS server for the IP address of www.google.com, 
and the DNS server will answer with something like 74.125.19.104. Your host will then again use your default 
gateway to leave your network and fetch the web page provided by www.google.com.
