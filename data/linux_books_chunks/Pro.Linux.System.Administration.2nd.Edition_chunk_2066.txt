We’ll do this by adding a variety of new disks, 
partitioning these disks, and then formatting and managing this storage.

Drives under Windows show up as a drive letter once you format them, but Linux works differently. It 
has no concept of drive letters, and formatting also doesn’t work quite in the same way. Instead, drives and 
storage appear as devices, which can be partitioned.
