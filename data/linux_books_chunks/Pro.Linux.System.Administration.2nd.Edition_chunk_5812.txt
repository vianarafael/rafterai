So to be clear, when the ansible commands look for the backup_database_password, it 
will then do a lookup for the vault_backup_database_password and return that value.

We will now encrypt this file with the ansible-vault command.

$ ansible-vault encrypt playbooks/group_vars/dbs/vault.yml

We are asked to create and enter a password, which we will also store securely.
Next we have the configuration files.
