It was soon realized that the available addresses would run out if every host that 
wanted to be on the Internet was given its own public IP address. NAT was invented to be able to have a 
private address space appear to come from a single IP address.

THE END OF NAT

iPv6 has of course saved us from the iPcalypse and there is no real need to NAt network addresses 
anymore.
