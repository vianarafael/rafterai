This means a legitimate e-mail can be marked as 
spam. If you delete your spam, you’ve lost this e-mail. Storing it in a folder for a period of time allows you to 
potentially find and retrieve these false positives.

We’re going to use the first method and move our spam e-mail into a special folder in our Maildir 
directory for later review.
