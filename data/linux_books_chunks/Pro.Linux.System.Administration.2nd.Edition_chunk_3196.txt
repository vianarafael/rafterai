you’ll find postfix powerful and easy to use and that it meets all your needs.

First, let’s see whether Postfix and Dovecot are already installed.

$ sudo rpm -q postfix dovecot
postfix-2.10.1-6.el7.x86_64
package dovecot is not installed

If one or more packages are not installed, we need to install them.
