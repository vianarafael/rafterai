Instead of multiple drives, for example, C:\ and D:\, 
with separate directory trees beneath them, all drives, partitions, and storage are located off the root, or /, 
directory.

How does this work? Linux drives and devices are mounted (this can occur automatically when 
you boot, or you can do it manually).
