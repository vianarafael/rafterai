So for the new “www” LV, you can use /dev/raid-volume/www. We shall create a 
XFS filesystem for this logical volume using the following:

$ sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/raid-volume/www

You can use the volume as if it were an ordinary partition and add it to the /etc/fstab file, so it is 

automatically mounted on /var/www when your host boots.
