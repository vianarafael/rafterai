If we wanted to change the 

openssl command to read CA information from the current directory, we would do the following:

dir = .

This tells OpenSSL to look in the current directory for directories and files needed to configure and sign 

certificates. For CentOS, this is already set to /etc/pki/CA. Ubuntu has this set to ./demoCA.
