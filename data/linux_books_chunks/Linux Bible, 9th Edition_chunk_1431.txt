Sometimes, the module you are trying to remove depends on other modules that may be 
loaded. For instance, the usbcore module cannot be unloaded while the USB printer mod-
ule (usblp) is loaded, as shown here:

# rmmod usbcore

ERROR: Module usbcore is in use by wacom,usblp,ehci_hcd,ohci_hcd

Instead of using rmmod to remove modules, you could use the modprobe -r command.
