With ACLs, a user can allow others 
to read, write, and execute ﬁ les and directories without leaving those ﬁ lesystem elements 
wide open or requiring the root user to change the user or group assigned to them.

Here are a few things to know about ACLs:

 ■ For ACLs to be used, they must be enabled on a ﬁ lesystem when that ﬁ lesystem 

is mounted.

 ■ In Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, ACLs are automatically enabled on any 

 ﬁ lesystem created when the system is installed.

 ■ If you create a ﬁ lesystem after installation (such as when you add a hard disk), 

you need to make sure that the acl mount option is used when the ﬁ lesystem is 
mounted (more on that later).

 ■ To add ACLs to a ﬁ le, you use the setfacl command; to view ACLs set on a ﬁ le, 

you use the getfacl command.

 ■ To set ACLs on any ﬁ le or directory, you must be the actual owner (user) assigned 

to it.
