Now that the postfix service is stopped, we will start it again.

$ sudo systemctl start postfix.service

Again there is no output to the console; we run the status to confirm that it is running.

‚óè postfix.service - Postfix Mail Transport Agent
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/postfix.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: active (running) since Thu 2016-04-28 11:51:45 AEST; 2s ago

What we have seen in this section is how to start, stop, and see the status of a service using the 

systemctl command.
