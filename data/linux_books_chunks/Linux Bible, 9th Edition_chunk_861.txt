The r 
stands for read, the w stands for write, and the x stands for execute permissions. If a dash 
appears instead of the letter, it means that permission is turned off for that associated 
read, write, or execute bit.

Because ﬁ les and directories are different types of elements, read, write, and execute 
 permissions on ﬁ les and directories mean different things.
