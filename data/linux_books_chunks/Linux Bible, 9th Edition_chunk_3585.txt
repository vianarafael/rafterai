The following commands show the nfs service not 
running currently and disabled:

# service nfs status
rpc.svcgssd is stopped
rpc.mountd is stopped
nfsd is stopped
# chkconfig --list nfs
nfs  0:off  1:off  2:off  3:off  4:off  5:off  6:off

As mentioned earlier, the rpcbind service must be running for NFS to work.
