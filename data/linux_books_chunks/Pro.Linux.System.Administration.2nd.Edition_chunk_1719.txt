others will use the 
services you are running (like a mail or a web server) to bypass your perimeter security and launch an 
attack from within your network (e.g., virus attacks, trojan attacks, script injection attacks).

Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS) are also increasingly common and very hard to mitigate 
against.
