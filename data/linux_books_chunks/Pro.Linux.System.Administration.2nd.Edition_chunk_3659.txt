The password needs to be eight or more 
characters and complex, requiring symbols, letters, and numbers. Once that has been entered, the setup of 
Samba completes quickly. Once it is complete, we can start our service.

$ sudo systemctl start samba-ad-dc

This starts the Samba service, and you can use the systemctl status samba-ad-dc command to check 

it has started alright.
