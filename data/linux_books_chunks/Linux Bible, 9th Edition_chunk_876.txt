The plus 
sign is used with chmod to turn permissions on:

The following chmod command results in this permission: rw-------

$ chmod u+rw files

The following chmod command results in this permission: --x--x--x

$ chmod a+x files

The following chmod command results in this permission: r-xr-x---

$ chmod ug+rx files

Using letters to change permission recursively with chmod generally works better than 
using numbers because you can change bits selectively, instead of changing all permission 
bits at once.
