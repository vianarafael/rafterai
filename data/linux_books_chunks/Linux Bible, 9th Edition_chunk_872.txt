For example, suppose you wanted to give 
an entire directory structure 755 permission (rwxr-xr-x), starting at the $HOME/myapps 
directory. To do that, you could use the -R option, as follows:

$ chmod -R 755 $HOME/myapps

All Ô¨Å les and directories below, and including, the myapps directory in your home directory 
will have 755 permissions set.
