On that second system, you need to make sure that the 
sshd service is running, that the Ô¨Å rewall is open, and that ssh is allowed for the user 
account you are trying to log in to (root is often blocked by sshd).

If you have only one Linux system, you can create an additional user account and simply 
simulate communications with another system by connecting to the name localhost 
instead.
