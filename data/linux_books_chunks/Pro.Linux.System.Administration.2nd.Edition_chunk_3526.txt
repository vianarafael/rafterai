E-mail is submitted to 
the socket, scanned, and then returned to the ClamAV milter with an assessment of whether it is a virus. This 
assessment is then added in the form of the X-Spam-Virus header to the scanned e-mail.

On CentOS, this socket is located by default in /var/run/clamd.scan/clamd.sock, and you can see a 

listing of it here:

$ sudo ls -l /var/run/clamd.scan/clamd.sock
