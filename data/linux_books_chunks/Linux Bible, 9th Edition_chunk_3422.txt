By default, anonymous login is allowed when querying the server (so I just pressed Enter 
when prompted for a password).

You can discern a number of things about the default Samba server setup from this output:

 ■ The default domain (this is a Windows domain and not a DNS domain) is set to 

MYGROUP.

 ■ The default server name is set to the current version of Samba, in this case Samba 

4.1.15.

 ■ All printers that are shared via the CUPS server on your Linux system are, by 

default, also made available from the Samba server running on that same system.

 ■ No directories are shared yet from the server.

 ■ There is no NetBIOS name service running yet from the Samba server.

Next, you can decide whether you want to run the NetBIOS name service on your 
Samba server.

Starting the NetBIOS (nmbd) name server
If no Windows domain server is running on the network, as is the case here, you can start 
the nmb service on the Samba host to provide that service.
