This file is updated by
the login program when entering the wrong password, so it contains failed login attempts.
Many computers will not have this file, resulting in no logging of failed login attempts.

[root@RHEL4b ~]# lastb
lastb: /var/log/btmp: No such file or directory
Perhaps this file was removed by the operator to prevent logging lastb\
 info.
[root@RHEL4b ~]#

The reason given for this is that users sometimes type their password by mistake instead
of their login, so this world readable file poses a security risk.
