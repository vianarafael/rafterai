Letâ€™s add the prompt to add to the password.

$ sudo ansible-playbook --list-hosts --ask-vault-pass -b playbooks/backup.yml
Vault password:

playbook: playbooks/backup.yml

  play #1 (backup.example.com):         TAGS: []
    pattern: [u'backup.example.com']
    hosts (1):
      backup.example.com

This should come as no surprise as we are targeting this host in the host: section of our playbook.
