If you did a different install type, make sure you have the following packages also added: 
libvirt-client (for the virsh command) and libvirt-daemon (to get the lib-
virtd service).

Step 4: Start services on the hypervisors
You need to make sure that the libvirtd service is running on both hypervisors. Start 
the sshd service as well.
