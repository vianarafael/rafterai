Whenever a host executes the check command, its address 
replaces the macro. This allows the same command to be used by multiple host objects. The macro is 
specified as the value of the -H option, which specifies the host to ping.

 You can get the help text from most nagios plug-ins by running the command with the --help 

 â–  Note 
option.
