To stop the iptables firewall
on Red Hat, use the service command.

root@RHELv4u4:~# service iptables stop
Flushing firewall rules:                                   [  OK  ]
Setting chains to policy ACCEPT: filter                    [  OK  ]
Unloading iptables modules:                                [  OK  ]
root@RHELv4u4:~# 

The  easy  way  to  configure  iptables,  is  to  use  a  graphical  tool  like  KDE's  kmyfirewall
or  Security  Level  Configuration  Tool.
