Using these keys, for example, an rsync  command 
could go into a cron script and automatically back up johndoe’s home directory every night.

Want to further secure your remote system? After you have the keys in place on your 
remote system for everyone you want to allow to log in to that system, you can set the 
sshd service on the remote system to not allow password authentication by changing the 
PasswordAuthentication setting in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config ﬁ le to no so it appears 
as follows:

PasswordAuthentication no

Then restart the sshd service (systemctl restart sshd).
