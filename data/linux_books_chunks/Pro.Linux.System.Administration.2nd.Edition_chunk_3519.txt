You create profiles for applications by defining what permissions an 
application will need, and you can manage this fairly easily with the tools that apparmor comes with.

to view the status of apparmor, you can issue the following:

$ sudo apparmor_status
apparmor module is loaded.
15 profiles are loaded.
15 profiles are in enforce mode.
   /sbin/dhclient
   /usr/bin/freshclam
   /usr/bin/lxc-start
...
4 processes have profiles defined.
4 processes are in enforce mode.
   /usr/bin/freshclam (2153)
   /usr/sbin/clamd (11998)
   /usr/sbin/mysqld (2997)
0 processes are in complain mode.
0 processes are unconfined but have a profile defined.

You can see that there is already a policy for the clamd service.
