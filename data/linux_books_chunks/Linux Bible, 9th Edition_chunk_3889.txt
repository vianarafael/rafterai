For recent releases of well-known distributions (RHEL, 

Fedora, or Ubuntu, for example), dependency problems are rare and often 
ﬁ xed quickly. However, if you are relying on repositories for older releases or 
 development-oriented repositories (such as Fedora’s Rawhide repository), expect 
to ﬁ nd more dependency problems.
