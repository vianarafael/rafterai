To allow this user to do administrative tasks without knowing the root 
password, select the “Make this user administrator” box.

  By clicking the Advanced box, you can change some of the default settings. 
For example, with a user named chris, the default home directory would be 
/home/chris, and the next available user ID and group ID are assigned to the 
user.
