However, 
in a restricted deletion directory, unless you are the root user or the owner of the 
 directory, you can never delete another user’s ﬁ les.

Typically, a restricted deletion directory is used as a place where lots of different users can 
create ﬁ les. For example, the /tmp directory is a restricted deletion directory:

$ ls -ld /tmp
drwxrwxrwt.
