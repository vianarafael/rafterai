When an application has a startup script associ-
ated with it, that script is placed in the /etc/init.d/ directory and then symbolically 
linked to a Ô¨Å le in each /etc/rc?.d/ directory.

Scripts linked to each /etc/rc?.d directory begin with either the letter K or S, followed 
by two numbers and the service name.
