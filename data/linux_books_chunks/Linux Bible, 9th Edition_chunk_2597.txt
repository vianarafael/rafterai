For example, create an
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 that looks like the following 
(then create eth1, eth2, eth3, and so on for each NIC you want to use in the bonding 
interface):

14

DEVICE=eth0
MASTER=bond0
SLAVE=yes
BOOTPROTO=none
ONBOOT=yes

With the eth0 interface used as part of the bond0 interface, there is no IP address 
assigned.
