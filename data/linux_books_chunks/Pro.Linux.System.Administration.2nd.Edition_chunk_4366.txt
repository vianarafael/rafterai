This isn’t much 

use to us because we can’t access any of the resources available on the internal network (e.g., a file share 
on the headoffice.example.com host). We can test this from our branch office host by trying to ping the 
headoffice host:

branch1$ ping 192.168.0.1

We’ll get no reply from these pings because there is no route to this network.
