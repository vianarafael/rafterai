Event handlers can perform tasks such as restarting services or 
deleting temporary files in an effort to automatically recover a host or service (see 
https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/
eventhandlers.html).

You can specify parent-child relationships and dependencies between hosts and 
services; for example, if a router is down, you can indicate you don’t want Nagios 
to bother to check hosts behind that router because they won’t be contactable (see 
https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/
dependencies.html).

You can design a distributed monitoring environment where there are redundant 
monitoring servers or where checks are distributed over multiple sites or locations 
(see https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/
en/distributed.html and https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/
docs/nagioscore/4/en/redundancy.html).
