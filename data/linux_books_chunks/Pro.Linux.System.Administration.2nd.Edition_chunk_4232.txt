To do that, we need to do 
the following.

First we need to edit the /etc/glusterfs/glusterd.vol file and add the following on each Gluster 

server:

volume management
    type mgmt/glusterd
    option working-directory /var/lib/glusterd
...<snip>...
    option rpc-auth-allow-insecure on
end-volume

We will need to restart the glusterd service after making this change.
