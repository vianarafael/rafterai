On the NFS client system, add an entry to the /etc/auto.master ﬁ le that 
identiﬁ es the mount point where you want the remote NFS directory to be 
mounted and a ﬁ le (of your choosing) where you will identify the location of 
the remote NFS directory. I added this entry to the auto.master ﬁ le:

/home/remote /etc/auto.joe
