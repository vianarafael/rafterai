Maybe we only want 

tcp packets with a destination address in our 192.168.10.0/24 network? That would look like this:

$ sudo /sbin/iptables –t filter –R INPUT 1 –s 0.0.0.0/0 –d 192.168.10.0/24 –p tcp –j IPV4-
INCOMING
num target     prot opt source    destination
1  IPV4-INCOMING tcp -- anywhere   192.168.10.0/24

We have now replaced a rule, by specifying -R, to the INPUT chain that directs only packets with the tcp 
protocol and only if their destination address in the 192.168.10.0/24 network.
