This matches the /proc/meminfo Shmem value 

(space used by the kernel).

The buffers column tells you the amount of memory the kernel is using to act as a disk write buffer. 

This buffer allows applications to write data quickly and have the kernel deal with writing it to disk in the 
background. Data can also be read from this buffer, providing an additional speed increase.
