The Persistence=true says to run if it missed the last start (like the system was shutdown).

Letâ€™s imagine we have a monitor.service file that makes a cURL POST request to a web site to tell us the 

system has booted, and checks in every 20 minutes after that.

[Unit]
Description=Tell the monitoring service we are up

[Timer]
OnBootSec=2min
OnUnitActiveSec=20min

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target

We will put this configuration into a file called /etc/systemd/system/monitor.timer, next to our 
monitor.service file.
