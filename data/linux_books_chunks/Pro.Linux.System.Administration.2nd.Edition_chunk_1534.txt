To get Host D 
to see Host F, we need to tell Host D to get to Host F via Host E. We do that by adding a route like this:

$ sudo /sbin/ip route add 192.168.10.0/24 via 192.168.0.2 dev enp0s8

Here we have to use the ip command combined with the route object to add a route to the 

192.168.10.0/24 network from our Host D.
