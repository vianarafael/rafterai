three sets of rwx

We  already  know  that  the  output  of  ls  -l    starts  with  ten  characters  for  each  file.  This
screenshot shows a regular file (because the first character is a - ).

paul@RHELv4u4:~/test$ ls -l proc42.bash
-rwxr-xr--  1 paul proj 984 Feb  6 12:01 proc42.bash

Below is a table describing the function of all ten characters.
