With Ansible, it is the same command to do 1 as it is to do 1,000.

$ ansible all_servers --become –m service –a "name=sshd state=restarted"

Here we have provided the hosts to target (all_servers), we will execute our command using sudo on 
the target host (--become), we want to use the service module (-m service), and that module will take the 
arguments -a "name=sshd state=restarted".

Each module has different arguments, and you can pass them as key/value pairs (key=value).
