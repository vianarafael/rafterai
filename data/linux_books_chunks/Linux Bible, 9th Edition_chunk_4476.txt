Keeping a user ignorant of what 
has  happened to an account is helpful if you are being attacked maliciously. The malicious 
attacker does not know the account has been locked and thinks he has just entered 
another incorrect password. This can allow you time to track down what is happening.

Using the quiet option can, however, cause lots of problems for your users.
