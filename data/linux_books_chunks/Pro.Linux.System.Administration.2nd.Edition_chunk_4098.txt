While we do that, we will also make sure that our Bareos File daemon is installed on headoffice.example.
com and that we have firewall access for TCP port 9103 on that host from backup.example.com.

We need to install the following packages on the host that will house the Bareos database; they contain 

the helper scripts that help manage the database:

$ sudo aptitude install –y bareo-database-common bareos-database-mysql

Of course, on CentOS, you would use the yum command.
On headoffice.example.com we will do the following:

$ sudo mysql –u root –p
Enter Password:
...
mysql> CREATE DATABASE 'bareos';
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON bareos.* to bareos@backup.example.com 

IDENTIFIED BY 'somepassword';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> \q;
Bye

In the previous code, we have created a database called bareos.
