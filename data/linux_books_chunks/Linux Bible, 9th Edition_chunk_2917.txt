Select the device to which the printer is connected. The printer can be 

connected locally to a parallel, SCSI, serial, or USB port directly on the com-
puter. Alternatively, you can select a network connection type for Apple printers 
(appSocket/HP JetDirect), Internet Printing Protocol (http or ipp), or a Windows 
printer (using Samba or SMB).
