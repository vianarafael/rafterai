Here is an 
example of what the output of that command looks like with a corrupted database:

# yum check
error: db4 error(11) from dbenv->open: Resource temporarily 
     unavailable
error: cannot open Packages index using db4 - Resource temporarily
     unavailable (11)
error cannot open Packages database in /var/lib/rpm
CRITICAL:yum.main:
Error: rpmdb open fails

The RPM database and other information about your installed RPM packages are stored in 
the /var/lib/rpm directory.
