We want to take a full 
backup of our data bimonthly, so we change the Schedule to look like this:

Schedule {
  Name = "WeeklyCycle"
  Run = Full 1st 3rd sun at 23:05
  Run = Differential 2nd 4th 5th sun at 23:05
  Run = Incremental mon-sat at 23:05
}
Schedule {
  Name = "WeeklyCycleAfterBackup"
  Run = Full sun-sat at 23:10
}

As described in the Schedule named WeeklyCycle, we are running a full backup on the first and third 
Sundays of every month.
