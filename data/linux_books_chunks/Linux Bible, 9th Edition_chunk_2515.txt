Packets are routed as follows:

 ■ A packet intended for the local system is sent to the lo interface.

 ■ A packet intended for a system on your local network is directed through your NIC 

directly to the intended recipient system’s NIC.

 ■ A packet intended for any other system is sent to the gateway (router) that directs 

the packet on to its intended address on the Internet.

Of course, what I have described here is one of the simplest cases.
