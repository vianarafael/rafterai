mount

The simplest and most common way to view all mounts is by issuing the mount command
without any arguments.

root@RHELv4u2:~# mount | grep /dev/sdb
/dev/sdb1 on /home/project42 type ext2 (rw)

7.2.2. /proc/mounts

The kernel provides the info in /proc/mounts in file form, but /proc/mounts does not exist
as a file on any hard disk.
