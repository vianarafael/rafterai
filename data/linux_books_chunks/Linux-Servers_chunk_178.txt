SELinux guards our ports

If we try to restart our server, we will notice the following error:

[root@CentOS65 ~]# service httpd restart
Stopping httpd:                                            [  OK  ]
Starting httpd: 
       (13)Permission denied: make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:7000
no listening sockets available, shutting down
                                                           [FAILED]

This is due to SELinux reserving ports 7000 and 8000 for other uses.
