This script initializes hardware, sets some basic environment, populates /etc/mtab
while mounting file systems, starts swap and more.

[paul@rhel ~]$ egrep -e"^# Ini" -e"^# Sta" -e"^# Che" /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit
# Check SELinux status
# Initialize hardware
# Start the graphical boot, if necessary; /usr may not be mounted yet...
# Initialiaze ACPI bits
# Check filesystems
# Start the graphical boot, if necessary and not done yet.
# Check to see if SELinux requires a relabel
# Initialize pseudo-random number generator
# Start up swapping.
# Initialize the serial ports.

That egrep command could also have been written with grep like this :

grep "^# \(Ini\|Sta\|Che\)".

/etc/init.d/rcS

Debian has the following line after initdefault.

si::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS

The /etc/init.d/rcS script will always run on Debian (independent of the selected runlevel).
The script is actually running all scripts in the /etc/rcS.d/ directory in alphabetical order.

root@barry:~# cat /etc/init.d/rcS 
#! /bin/sh
#
# rcS
#
# Call all S??* scripts in /etc/rcS.d/ in numerical/alphabetical order
#

exec /etc/init.d/rc S
