The traffic running over a VPN is usually encrypted and authenticated via a mechanism such as an TLS/SSL 
certificate, a password, or a two-factor authentication mechanism such as a token or smartcard.

VPNs are commonplace and home and business-grade firewalls will usually have support for them.
In this chapter, we’re going to show you how to install the required software (in our case, an open 

source VPN tool called OpenVPN) to create a VPN and how to configure and generate VPN tunnels.

Our Example Network
We’re going to demonstrate a variety of VPN connections in this chapter, and we’ll use the example network 
we created in Chapter 7 for our sample environment and network to configure.
