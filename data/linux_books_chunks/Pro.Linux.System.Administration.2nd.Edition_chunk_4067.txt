We can use a time argument to reduce the output 
and grep to further narrow what we are looking for (duply nightly list 2016-10-15 | grep /usr/sbin).
From the list we are going to now fetch one of the files (/bin/bash) from our backup and copy it to the 

local /tmp directory.

$ sudo duply nightly fetch bin/bash /tmp/restores/bash
Start duply v1.11, time is 2016-10-16 11:41:15.
