Lastly, weâ€™ve used the cert and 
key options to specify the location of our certificate and key files, respectively, in our case /etc/pki/tls/
certs/gateway.example.com.cert and /etc/pki/tls/private/gateway.example.com.key.

The tls-auth key needs to be specified as tls-auth <key> 0 on the server and tls-auth <key> 1 on 

the clients.
