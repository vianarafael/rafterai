/etc/exports

Here is a sample /etc/exports to explain the syntax:

paul@laika:~$ cat /etc/exports 
# Everyone can read this share
/mnt/data/iso  *(ro)

# Only the computers named pasha and barry can readwrite this one
/var/www pasha(rw) barry(rw)

# same, but without root squashing for barry
/var/ftp pasha(rw) barry(rw,no_root_squash)

# everyone from the netsec.local domain gets access
/var/backup       *.netsec.local(rw)

# ro for one network, rw for the other
/var/upload   192.168.1.0/24(ro) 192.168.5.0/24(rw)

More recent incarnations of nfs require the subtree_check option to be explicitly set (or
unset with no_subtree_check).
