To start that service, enable it (so it starts each time your 
system boots) and check the status by running the following three commands:

# systemctl start nfs-server.service
# systemctl enable nfs-server.service
# systemctl status nfs-server.service
nfs-server.service - NFS Server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/nfs-server.service; enabled)
     Active: active (exited) since Mon 2014-9-01 15:15:11 EDT; 24s 
        ago
   Main PID: 7767 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
     CGroup: /system.slice/nfs-server.service

You can see from the status that the nfs-server service is enabled and active.
