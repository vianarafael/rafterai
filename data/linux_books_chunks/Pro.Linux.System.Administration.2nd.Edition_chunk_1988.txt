It is usually a very long list, but we can 
pipe the output from dpkg into the more command and display the output page by page (see Listing 8-19). 
We can then scroll through it at our leisure.

Listing 8-19.  Piping the dpkg -l Output to More

$ dpkg -l | more

Notice in FigureÂ 8-39 that dpkg lists output in four columns: status, name, version, and description.
