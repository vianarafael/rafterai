Finally, the date and time the device file was last modified

The actual device file name consists of the prefix sd and a letter indicating which disk it belongs to. The 
first detected disk is sda, the second is sdb, the third is sdc, and so on. Finally, each partition on the disk gets 
its own device node as well, and the partition number is the final part of the name.
