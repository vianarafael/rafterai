We have declared the user 
and group, and we have placed our --sysconfdir (system configuration directory) in /etc/nagios, which 
is common in CentOS (in Ubuntu it is normally /etc/nagios<version  number>, but we are not choosing 
that here).

Now we need to compile the source code and then install the various components.

$ sudo make all
$ sudo bash -c 'make install
make install-init
make install-config
make install-commandmode
make install-webconf'

The configuration files are installed in /etc/nagios, and the Nagios binary is installed in /usr/local/

nagios/bin/nagios.
