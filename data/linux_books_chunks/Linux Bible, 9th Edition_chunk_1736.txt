So, for example, it would be up to the Fedora project to 
make sure that every component needed by every package in its Linux distribution could 
be resolved by some other package in the repository.

Repositories could also build on each other. So, for example, the rpmfusion.org repository 
could assume that a user already had access to the main Fedora repository.
