To be safe, I use a USB ﬂ ash drive that doesn’t contain any data I want to 
keep to practice partitioning.

Changing partitioning can make a system 
unbootable!
I don’t recommend using your system’s primary hard disk to practice changing partitioning because 
a mistake can make your system unbootable.
