Yes — it’s free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs. It is NOT 
protable [sic] (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support 
anything other than AT-harddisks, as that’s all I have :-(.

Minix was a UNIX-like operating system that ran on PCs in the early 1990s. Like Minix, 
Linux was also a clone of the UNIX operating system.
