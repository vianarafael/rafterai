[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ echo $$
4224                                # PID of bash
[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ ksh
$ echo $$ $PPID
5343 4224                           # PID of ksh and bash
$ exec bash
[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ echo $$ $PPID
5343 4224                           # PID of bash and bash
[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ exit
exit
[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ echo $$
