The enp0s9 interface again mirrors the enp0s8 configuration.

Moving on to the bond device, we can set that like the following:

# The primary network interface
auto bond0
iface bond0 inet static
address 192.168.0.10
netmask 255.255.255.0
bond-mode active-backup
bond-miimon 100
bond_downdelay 25
bond_updelay 25
bond-primary enp0s8
bond-slaves enp0s8 enp0s9

In the first line, auto bond0, we have declared here that the bond0 device should be loaded 

automatically at boot time.
