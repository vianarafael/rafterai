But what does the /24 
mean?

Due to the limited address space of iPv4 it was necessary to conserve iP addresses, which is how the 
idea of carving up the address space into smaller chunks, or subnetting, came about. iPv4 addresses 
are made up of 32 binary bits. these bits are broken up into 4 octets (1 octet is 8bits).
