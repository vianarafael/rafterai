For RHEL/CentOS check the theory.

Decide  (with  a  partner)  on  a  computer  to  be  the  Target  and  another  computer  to  be  the
Initiator.

On the Target computer:

First install iscsitarget using the standard tools for installing software in your distribution.
Then use your knowledge from the previous chapter to setup a logical volume (/dev/vg/
lvol0) and use the RAID chapter to setup /dev/md0.
