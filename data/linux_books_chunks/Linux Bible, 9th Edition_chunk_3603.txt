However, add no 
spaces between a hostname and its options. For example:

/usr/local maple(rw) spruce(ro,root_squash)

Notice that there is a space after (rw) but none after maple. You can identify hosts in 
 several ways:

 ■ Individual host—Enter one or more TCP/IP hostnames or IP addresses. If the host is 
in your local domain, you can simply indicate the hostname.
