Because just typing man passwd displays the section 1 page, I need to explicitly 
request the section 5 man page if I want to see that instead (man 5 passwd).

While you are displaying a man page, you can view different parts of the Ô¨Å le using Page 
Down and Page Up keys (to move a page at a time). Use the Enter key or up and down 
arrows to move a line at a time.
