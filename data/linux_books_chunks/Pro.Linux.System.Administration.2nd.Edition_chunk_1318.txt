In Debian-
style hosts NetworkManager is disabled for managing interfaces listed in /etc/network/interfaces unless 
you specifically change the following in the /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf to:

[ifupdown]
managed=true

Some people choose not to run NetworkManager because they find it too intrusive and they prefer to 
manage their networks themselves.
