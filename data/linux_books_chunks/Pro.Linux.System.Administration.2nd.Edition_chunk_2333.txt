The problem is, once 
you partition a disk, itâ€™s hard to resize the partitions or to add an additional one. Even if you do add disks and 
partitions, your data can become spread over a variety of locations and directories. This makes it harder to 
consolidate, back up, and manage your data, and it potentially makes it harder for your users to find their 
data.
