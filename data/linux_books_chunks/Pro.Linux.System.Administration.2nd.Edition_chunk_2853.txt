You can see the variables you can use in VARNAMEs at http://httpd.
apache.org/docs/current/expr.html.

In the CentOS httpd.conf file we had the Listen directive; on Ubuntu, Apache loads information about 
which IP addresses and ports it should listen on from the ports.conf file; the default of that file is as follows:

Listen 80

<IfModule ssl_module>
    Listen 443
</IfModule>

<IfModule mod_gnutls.c>
    Listen 443
</IfModule>

In this file you will see how to defensively add directives for modules.
