Here’s how it works:

 ■ You create a public key and a private key.

 ■ You guard the private key, but copy the public key across to the user account on 

the remote host to which you want to do key-based authentication.

 ■ With your keys copied to the proper locations, you use any SSH tools to connect 

to the user account on the remote host, but instead of asking you for a password, 
the remote SSH service compares the public key and the private key and allows you 
access if the two keys match.

When you create the keys, you are given the option to add a passphrase to your private 
key.
