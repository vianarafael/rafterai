Given that the user chris in this 
example has read-write permission to the shared directory, users on your system should be 
able to read and write to the mounted directory. Regardless of who saves ﬁ les on the shared 
directory, on the server those ﬁ les are owned by the user chris. This mount lasts until the 
system is rebooted or you run the umount command on the directory.
