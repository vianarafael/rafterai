The fi statement then indicates that the 
if statement is complete and processing can continue.

VARIABLE=1
if [ $VARIABLE -eq 1 ] ; then
echo "The variable is 1"
fi

Instead of using -eq, you can use the equal sign (=), as shown in the following example. 
The = works best for comparing string values, while -eq is often better for comparing 
 numbers.
