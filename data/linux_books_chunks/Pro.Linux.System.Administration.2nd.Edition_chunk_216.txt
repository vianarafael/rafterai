In this exercise we’ll use the full-size ISO from www.ubuntu.
com/download/server.

 ■ Note  Ubuntu and Debian make good use of net installers, providing installation flexibility. a net installer is 
a small version of the operating system usually provided as an ISO file that you can burn to a CD/USB drive and 
boot from. It contains a simple kernel and the distribution’s installer.
