display the runlevel

You can see your current runlevel with the runlevel or who -r commands.

The runlevel command is typical Linux and will output the previous and the current runlevel.
If there was no previous runlevel, then it will mark it with the letter N.

[root@RHEL4b ~]# runlevel 
N 3

The history of who -r dates back to Seventies Unix, it still works on Linux.

[root@RHEL4b ~]# who -r
         run-level 3  Jul 28 09:15                   last=S
