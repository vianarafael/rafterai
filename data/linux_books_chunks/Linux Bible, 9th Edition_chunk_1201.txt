The string done ends the for statement.

If you’re a die-hard C programmer, bash allows you to use C syntax to control your loops:

LIMIT=10
# Double parentheses, and no $ on LIMIT even though it's a variable!
for ((a=1; a <= LIMIT ; a++)) ; do
  echo  "$a"
done

The “while…do” and “until…do” loops
Two other possible looping constructs are the while...do loop and the until...do loop.
