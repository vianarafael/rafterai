Earlier releases of other distributions 
adopted it for a short time before transitioning to systemd, including:

 ■ RHEL version 6

 ■ Fedora versions 9 through 14

 ■ Ubuntu versions 6–14.10

 ■ openSUSE versions 11.3–12.1

A new daemon, systemd, available at http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Systemd,
