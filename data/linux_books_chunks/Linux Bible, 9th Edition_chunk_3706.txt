Likewise, you could use a 
 central authentication mechanism, such as LDAP (as described in Chapter 11, “Managing 
User Accounts”), to offer centralized user accounts as well.

The following procedure illustrates how to set up a user account on an NFS server and share 
the home directory of a user named joe from that server so it can be automounted when 
joe logs into a different computer.
