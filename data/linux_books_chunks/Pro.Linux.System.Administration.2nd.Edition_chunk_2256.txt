If this 
happens, attempting to mount the filesystem by using the UUID reference would result in an error like the 
following:

$ sudo mount /mnt/datax
mount: special device /dev/disk/by-uuid/ccd60fc3-bbaf-40e5-a93e-43743f9176d9
    does not exist

You can cause the UUID to be redetected and the correct symbolic link in /dev/disk/by-uuid to be 

created by reloading the udev service.
