We will 

create a file /etc/bareos/bareos-dir.d/admin.conf if it is not already created by your installation process.

Console {
  Name = "admin"
  Password = "secret"
  Profile = "webui"
}

Next we will need to create the file /etc/bareos/bareos-dir.d/webui-consoles.conf and enter the 

following contents for the file:

Profile {
  Name = webui
   CommandACL = status, messages, show, version, run, rerun, cancel, .api, .bvfs_*, list, 

llist, use, restore, .jobs, .filesets, .clients

  Job ACL = *all*
  Schedule ACL = *all*

  Catalog ACL = *all*
  Pool ACL = *all*
  Storage ACL = *all*
  Client ACL = *all*
  FileSet ACL = *all*
  Where ACL = *all*
}

This profile relates to the commands that the admin user can access using the webui profile.
