Then I use parentheses to set NUM_FILES to the num-
ber of Ô¨Å les in the current directory by piping (|) the output of the ls command to the 
word count command (wc -l).

MACHINE=`uname -n`
NUM_FILES=$(/bin/ls | wc -l)

Variables can also contain the value of other variables. This is useful when you have to 
 preserve a value that will change so you can use it later in the script.
