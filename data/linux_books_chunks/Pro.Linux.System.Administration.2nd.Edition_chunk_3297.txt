For Ubuntu, we would issue the following:

$ for h in http https ;do sudo ufw allow $h ;done

Or on CentOS we would issue the following:

$ for h in http https; do sudo firewall-cmd --zone public --add-service=$h ;done

Once this is done, we can use Certbot to create our certificates for our mail host.
