On CentOS, we issue the following:

gateway$ sudo yum install nagios-plugins nagios-plugins-load

On Ubuntu, you can install the plug-ins like we did on the Nagios server, or you should be able to install 

them from the APT repository.

gateway$ sudo apt-get install nagios-plugins

We can then define a command that uses the check_by_ssh plug-in to monitor a service on the remote 

host.
