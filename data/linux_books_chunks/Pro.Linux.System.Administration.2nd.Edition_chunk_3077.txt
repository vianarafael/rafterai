ideally this host should 
be restricted or disconnected from the network when it is now being used, and having this on a web 
server is dangerous. having a dedicated host is our strong recommendation.

One good way of securing your Ca is to have a dedicated virtual image that resides on a password-
protected encrypted disk.
