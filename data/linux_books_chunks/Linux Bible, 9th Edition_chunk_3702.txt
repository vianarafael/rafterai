The ls 
 command, for example, doesn’t show anything under a network-mounted directory until 
the directory is mounted, which may lead to a sometimes-it’s-there-and-sometimes-it’s-
not impression. Just change to a network-mounted directory, or access a ﬁ le on such a 
 directory, and autofs takes care of the rest.

In the example shown, the hostname shuttle is used.
