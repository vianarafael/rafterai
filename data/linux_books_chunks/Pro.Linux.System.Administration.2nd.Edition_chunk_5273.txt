Each 

service uses particular commands to check its status, and each command specifies the binary or script used 
to check the status of a service.

 You will also define commands to send notifications (for example, to generate an e-mail or send a 

 â–  Note 
page) when a service check fails.

To make creating commands easier, Nagios comes with a collection of plug-ins, which are binaries 
designed to check specific services; for example, Nagios has a plug-in called check_icmp that uses IMCP 
ping requests to confirm a host is active.

Nagios can query services on the localhost as well as remote hosts.
