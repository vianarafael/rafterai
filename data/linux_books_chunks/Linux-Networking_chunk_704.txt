The OUTPUT chain is for any packet leaving the system.
And the FORWARD chain is for packets that are forwarded (routed) through the system.

The screenshot below shows how to list the filter table and all its rules.

[root@RHEL5 ~]# iptables -t filter -nL
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         
[root@RHEL5 ~]#

As you can see, all three chains in the filter table are set to ACCEPT everything.
