These limits are defined 
with the discard option, and since we haven’t defined such limits, it’s not used here. notrap rejects any 
control packets that get sent, while nomodify disallows attempts to modify the time on the server. nopeer 
ensures your server doesn’t start using a connecting client as an upstream NTP server.
