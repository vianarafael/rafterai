The new RHEL system is installed, by default, on the 

local hard drive using automatic partitioning. You also have the option of  attaching 
network storage or special storage, such as Firmware RAID. (See the  section 
“Partitioning Hard Drives” later in this chapter for details on conﬁ guring  storage.) 
Click Done when you are ﬁ nished.
