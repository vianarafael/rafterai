We can 

add something like this into our rc.local file:

/etc/rc.d/rc.local
/sbin/ip addr add 192.168.0.24/24 brd 192.168.0.255 dev enp0s3
/sbin/ip addr add 192.168.0.25/24 brd 192.168.0.255 dev enp0s3
/sbin/ip addr add 192.168.0.26/24 brd 192.168.0.255 dev enp0s3

In the foregoing we are adding the IPv4 addresses 192.168.0.24-26 to our enp0s3 address when our 
host is rebooted.
