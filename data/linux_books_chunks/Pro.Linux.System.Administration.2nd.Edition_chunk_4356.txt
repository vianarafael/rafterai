On the gateway host you can see a new interface called tun0 with an IP address of 10.8.0.1 (as 
mentioned earlier).

[gateway]$ ip addr show tun0
5: tun0: <POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN 
qlen 100
    link/none
    inet 10.8.0.1 peer 10.8.0.2/32 scope global tun0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

On the branch1 host an interface, also called tun0, has been created with an IP address of 10.8.0.6 from 

the pool of addresses our server is offering.

[branch1]$ ip addr show tun0
5: tun0: <POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN 
group default qlen 100
    link/none
    inet 10.8.0.6 peer 10.8.0.5/32 scope global tun0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

You can also see the route table on the branch1 host (using the ip command introduced in Chapter 7) 

has a route for our 10.8.0.0/24 network.

branch1$ ip route show
sudo ip route show
default via 10.0.2.2 dev enp0s3
10.0.2.0/24 dev enp0s3  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.0.2.15
10.8.0.1 via 10.8.0.5 dev tun0
10.8.0.5 dev tun0  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.8.0.6
192.168.0.0/24 dev enp0s8  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.0.2.156

There is a route to the 10.8.0.1 host via the tun0 interface.
You’ll notice that on both hosts a file called /var/log/openvpn-status.log has been created.
