The next line tells you that this 
will inherit the object class SUP top. The SUP stands for superior, and top means that this object class has no 
parent object class; it is the highest in the object class hierarchy. Other subsequent object classes may use 
this object class as their SUP, or inherited, object class.

The AUXILIARY indicates the type of object class.
