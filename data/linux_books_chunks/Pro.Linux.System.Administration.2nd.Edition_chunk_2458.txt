And what if we looked at 0.au.pool.ntp.org

$ host 0.au.pool.ntp.org
0.au.pool.ntp.org has address 129.250.35.251
0.au.pool.ntp.org has address 27.124.125.252
0.au.pool.ntp.org has address 121.0.0.41
0.au.pool.ntp.org has address 129.250.35.250

Well isnâ€™t that interesting. You should test the results from 0.us.pool.ntp.org and see what you 

get.
