We 
are going to use the setup module, a module that gathers the facts that we can use in our tasks or playbooks.

$ ansible –c local localhost –m setup
localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "ansible_all_ipv4_addresses": [
            "192.168.0.61",
            "10.0.2.15"
        ],
...
        "ansible_virtualization_type": "virtualbox",
        "module_setup": true
    },
    "changed": false
}

There is a long list of Ansible facts returned as a JSON string; we have shown only a small portion.
