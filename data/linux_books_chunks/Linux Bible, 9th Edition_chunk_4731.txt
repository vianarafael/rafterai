If your Linux system’s sshd does not use TCP 
Wrappers, then no output is shown.

$ ldd /usr/sbin/sshd | grep libwrap
libwrap.so.0 => /lib/libwrap.so.0 (0x0012f000)

When a network service that incorporates TCP Wrapper support is requested, the hosts.
allow and hosts.deny ﬁ les are scanned and checked for an entry that matches the 
address of the remote system making the request.
