Also, 
we really hope fewer people require printing as there are many alternative ways to transport and read 
documents in this day and age.

If you still need to set up a printer on your network (for example, you have a USB printer and you want 

to share that among the hosts on your network), you can attach it to a Linux server or even attach it to a small 
Raspberry Pi and use the CUPS print server.

 There are many uses for a raspberry pi; one of them is being a print server.
