The umask dictates the default set of permissions assigned to a file 
when it is created. By default, without a umask set, files are created with permissions of 0666 (or read and 
write permissions for the owner, group, and others are all set), and directories are created with permissions 
of 0777 (or read, write, and execute for the owner, group, and others).
