the kernel 
doesnâ€™t assume that there will be a logging daemon to write these message to a file, like during system 
boot-up for example. therefore, the kernel writes all its messages to the ring buffer and you can access 
the messages via dmesg.

the ring buffer of the kernel contains things like how kernel was called, the hardware the kernel found, 
and what it did once it found it.
