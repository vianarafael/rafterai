Using pipes 
(described earlier), you can direct standard output from one command to the standard 
input of another. With ﬁ les, you can use less than (<) and greater than (>) signs to direct 
data to and from ﬁ les. Here are the ﬁ le-redirection characters:

 ■ <—Directs the contents of a ﬁ le to the command.
