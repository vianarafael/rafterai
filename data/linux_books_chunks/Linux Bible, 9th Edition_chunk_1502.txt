If that is not possible, you can 
download an installation DVD from a mirror site of the CentOS project to get a 
 similar experience: http://wiki.centos.org/Download.

  For this example, I used the 3.4G RHEL 7 Server DVD ISO named rhel-server-

7.0-x86_64-dvd.iso. After you have the DVD ISO, you can burn it to a physical 
DVD as described in Appendix A.

2.  Boot the installation media.
