In this 
VirtualHost we have added our TLS/SSL keys pointing to our /etc/ldap/certs directory and have created 
separate log files in the /var/log/apache2 directory to aid diagnosis of any problems relating to this 
VirtualHost.

We have included (Include /etc/.../apache.conf) the Apache configuration file provided by the 

LAM package.
