A common 
use of here text is to use it with a text editor to create or add to a ﬁ le from within a script:

/bin/ed /etc/resolv.conf <<resendit
a
nameserver 100.100.100.100
.
w
q
resendit

With these lines added to a script run by the root user, the ed text editor adds the IP 
address of a DNS server to the /etc/resolv.conf ﬁ le.
