Chapter 19 ■ CoNfiguratioN MaNageMeNt

We recommend you create a DNS CNAME for your Puppet host (e.g., puppet.example.com) or add it to 

your /etc/hosts file.

# /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 localhost
192.168.0.1 au-mel-ubuntu-1 puppet puppetmaster puppet.example.com puppetmaster.example.com

 ■ Note 

 We cover how to create CNAMEs in Chapter 10.

Writing the Manifest
We’re going to store our actual configuration in a directory called manifests under the /etc/puppetlabs/
code/environments/production directory.
