We do this 

by adding the push option to our mobile.conf configuration on the gateway host and use it to push a route.

push "route 192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0"

We also need to update the firewall rules on our gateway host, in much the same way as we added rules 

for the branch to head office tunnel.
