Reboot again, and when you see the BIOS screen, look for some words that 
say something like “Boot Order.” The onscreen instructions may say to press the F12 or F1 key. Press that key imme-
diately from the BIOS screen. Next, you should see a screen that shows available selections. Highlight an entry for 
CD/DVD or USB drive, and press Enter to boot the live image.
