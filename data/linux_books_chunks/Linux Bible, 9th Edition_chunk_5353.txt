To install the lftp FTP client (if you don’t have a second Linux system, install 

lftp on the same host running the FTP server) and try to upload the /etc/hosts 
ﬁ le to the incoming directory on the server, run the following commands as the 
root user:

# yum install lftp
# lftp localhost
lftp localhost:/> cd in
lftp localhost:/in> put /etc/hosts
89 bytes transferred
lftp localhost:/in> quit

You won’t be able to see that you copied the hosts ﬁ le to the incoming directory.
