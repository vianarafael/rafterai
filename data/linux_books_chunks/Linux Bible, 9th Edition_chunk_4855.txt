Authentication is necessary for 
those who are using cloud features as well as for those who are allowed to administer cloud 
features.

Cloud platform projects sometimes let you connect centralized authentication mechanisms 
to validate and authorize cloud users. These can include Kerberos, Microsoft Active Directory, 
and others.
