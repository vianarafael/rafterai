Rebooting the system 
always changes the mode back to what is set in that conﬁ guration ﬁ le. The preferred 
method of changing the SELinux mode is to modify the conﬁ guration ﬁ le and then reboot 
the system.

When switching from disabled to either enforcing or permissive mode, SELinux auto-
matically relabels the ﬁ lesystem after a reboot.
