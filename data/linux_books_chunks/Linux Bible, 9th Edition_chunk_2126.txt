Obtain a disk with some spare space on it and create a disk partition on it of the 
LVM type (8e). Then use the pvcreate command to identify this partition as an 
LVM physical volume. The process of doing this is described in the section “Creating 
a multiple-partition disk” using the /dev/sdc6 device in that example.
