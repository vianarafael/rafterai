To use the netstat command to see which ports the httpd server is listening on, 

type the following:

# netstat -tupln | grep httpd
tcp6     0   0 :::80      :::*    LISTEN   2496/httpd
tcp6     0   0 :::443     :::*    LISTEN   2496/httpd

5.  Try to connect to your Apache web server from a web browser that is outside the 
local system.
