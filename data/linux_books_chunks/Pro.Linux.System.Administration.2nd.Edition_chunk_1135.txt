Runlevel 1 is the single-user mode, 
or maintenance mode, that we described earlier in this chapter. Runlevel 6 is used when your host is being 
rebooted.

The runlevels on Ubuntu and CentOS hosts differ slightly. On Ubuntu, the runlevels 2 to 5 all run what 

is called multiuser mode. Multiuser mode is the mode where multiple users can sign in, not just a single 
console user.
