If you are going to use TCP 

Wrappers, it is a good idea to set the following in hosts.deny:

ALL: ALL

287

CHAPter 7 â–  NetworkiNg AND FirewAllS

This will set the default action of denial to all services unless specified in the /etc/hosts.allow file. The 

rules are read in order from top to bottom.

You would then add network services.
