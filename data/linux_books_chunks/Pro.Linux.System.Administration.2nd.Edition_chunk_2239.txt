In this case, the filesystem will be immediately mounted in read-only 
mode. This prevents additional data corruption while keeping files readable to services and users.

The other two possible values for error behavior are continue, which would cause the system to write a 
log entry but otherwise ignore the problem, and panic, which would cause the system to crash ungracefully.
