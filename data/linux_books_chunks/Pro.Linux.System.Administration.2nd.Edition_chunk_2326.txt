A quick check of /

proc/mdstat now shows that both sde1 and sdf1 are listed as spares.

$ cat /proc/mdstat
Personalities : [raid1] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4]
md0 : active raid5 sdg[5](S) sde[4] sdf[3](S) sdd[1] sdc[0]
      16765952 blocks super 1.2 level 5, 512k chunk, algorithm 2 [3/3] [UUU]

unused devices: <none>

And now you can expand the array from three to four active disks with mdadm in grow mode.
