The min options (-amin, -cmin, and -mmin) do the same in minutes.

Numbers that you give as arguments to the min and time options are preceded by a 
hyphen (to indicate a time from the current time to that number of minutes or days ago) or 
a plus (to indicate time from the number of minutes or days ago and older).
