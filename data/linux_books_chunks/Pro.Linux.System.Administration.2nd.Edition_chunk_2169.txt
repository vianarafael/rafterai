If you 
are mainly storing files smaller than 4 KB in size, you might opt to use a different, smaller, block size 
for your filesystem. Likewise, if your files are expected to be much larger than 4 KB you might choose a 
larger block size.

It is important to trial and test the performance of different block sizes when you are setting up servers 
for specific tasks.
