Bareos will automatic start a full backup if it does not exist yet. A new volume 
has been created, and the backup is restoring to it. If you type mess at the command line, you will receive 
any messages that are available about your job.

Now if we wanted to stop this job, we would use the cancel command with JobId 1 as an argument.
