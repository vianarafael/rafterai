The defaults should be fine, but you might 
want to adjust skip_addresses and set the debug_level (1 to 5 with 5 being most verbose).

Now when you send a test e-mail, you will see the following header being added to the e-mail (which 

SpamAssasin will use in the calculation of spam scores):

X-Spam-Checker-Version: SpamAssassin 3.4.0 (2014-02-07) on
        ip-10-0-10-154.ap-southeast-2.compute.internal

Chapter 12 ■ Mail ServiCeS

You can see now we have Received-SPF: Pass (sender SPF authorized), which means that we have 

looked up the TXT record for example.net and found that mail.example.net was able to send mail for the 
example.net domain.

Let’s now look at setting up Domain Key Identified Mail.

DKIM

Domain Key Identified Mail is where we will add a signature header to the mail we send so that other mail 
servers can verify it came from us via our published public key.
