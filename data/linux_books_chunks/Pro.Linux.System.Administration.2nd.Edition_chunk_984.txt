By default, your host will usually 
try to boot from an attached hard drive and, if configured, look for alternatives such as a CD/DVD drive or a 
USB key.

Every motherboard manufacturer has a different way of getting to the boot source menu, for example, 

by pressing Esc, Del, or a function key such as F1, F2, or F10.
