So, using the desk analogy, if I am working on nine active projects 
and there is space on the desk to hold the information I need for all nine projects, why not 
leave them all within reach on the desk? Following that same way of thinking, the kernel 
sometimes keeps libraries and other content in RAM that it thinks you might eventually 
need, even if a process is not looking for it immediately.

The fact that the kernel is inclined to store information in RAM that it expects may be 
needed soon (even if it is not needed now) can cause an inexperienced system administra-
tor to think that the system is almost out of RAM and that processes are about to start 
failing.
