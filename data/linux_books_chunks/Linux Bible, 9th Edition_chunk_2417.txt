Disk space is shown in 
1KB blocks. To produce output in a more human-readable form, use the -h option:

$ df -h
Filesystem            Size  Used  Avail  Use%   Mounted on
/dev/sda3              29G  2.9G    24G   11%   /
/dev/sda2              46M  8.2M    25M   19%   /boot
...

With the df -h option, output appears in a friendlier megabyte or gigabyte listing.
