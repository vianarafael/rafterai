As an example, when a client 
requests a URL from the server that is not found, the following ErrorDocument line 
causes the 404 error code to send the client an error message that is listed in the 
/var/www/error/HTTP_NOT_FOUND.html.var ﬁ le.

ErrorDocument 404 /error/HTTP_NOT_FOUND.html.var

Another common use for location blocks and access control ﬁ les is to limit or expand access 
to a resource.
