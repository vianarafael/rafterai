There are several ways to 
define your root and main branches. Some people choose a layout based on their DNS domains, as we have 
here, and some people use geographic locations, such as o=US, o=AU, or o=DE, as their root. In our case, we 
choose to use the DNS naming standard as we are not overly concerned about the geographic locations of 
our organization.
