But it is also good practice to document your samba
configuration, and to explicitly set options that have the same default values. The testparm
-s option allows you to do both. It will output the smallest possible samba configuration file,
while retaining all your settings. The idea is to have your samba configuration in another
file (like smb.conf.full) and let testparm parse this for you.
