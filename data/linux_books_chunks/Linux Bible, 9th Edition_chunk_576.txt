Here are two common ways to launch a Terminal window 
from a Linux desktop:

 ■ Right-click the desktop. In the context menu that appears, if you see Open in 
Terminal, Shells, New Terminal, Terminal Window, Xterm, or some similar item, 
select it to start a Terminal window. (Some distributions have disabled this feature.)

 ■ Click the panel menu.
