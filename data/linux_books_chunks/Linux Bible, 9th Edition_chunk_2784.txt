The 
 following example shows how to reload the cups daemon.

# service cups status
cupsd (pid 8236) is running...
# service cups reload
Reloading cups:            [  OK  ]
# service cups status
cupsd (pid 8236) is running...

If a SysVinit service is stopped when you attempt to reload it, you get a FAILED status.
