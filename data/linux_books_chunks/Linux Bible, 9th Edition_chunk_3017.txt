The following 
example from a printers.conf entry earlier in this chapter demonstrates what the new 
entry would look like:

<DefaultPrinter printer>

DeviceURI parallel:/dev/lp0
State Idle

On Linux systems that use the Print Settings window described earlier in this chapter, 
itâ€™s best to set up your printer as a shared printer using that window.
