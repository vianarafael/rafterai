For example, it may check 
http://169.254.169.254/2009-04-04/meta-data/ for meta-data and 
http://169.254.169.254/2009-04-04/user-data/ for user-data. This allows the 
conﬁ guration data to be stored and accessed from a central location.

As for what might be inside the meta-data and user-data, far more complex conﬁ guration 
schemes can be developed for deployment of your cloud instances.
