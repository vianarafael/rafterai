The private key needs to be kept secret.

The general idea of asymmetric key cryptography is shown in Figure 23.2. A  plaintext 
ﬁ le is encrypted using a public key of a key pair. The encrypted ﬁ le then can be 
securely  transmitted to another person. To decrypt the ﬁ le, the private key is used. 
This private key must be from the public/private key pair.
