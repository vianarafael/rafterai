The last thing we need to 

do is make sure we have a systemd service file to start the service.

$ sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/nagios.service

Because there is no native systemd service file available for Ubuntu just yet, the Nagios installation will 

deploy the /etc/init.d/nagios file, and we just have to point this service file at it (we spoke about Ubuntu’s 
adoption of systemd in Chapter 6 and how it still uses some LSB init files to start services).

Starting Nagios
On both CentOS and Ubuntu, we start and stop Nagios with the systemctl command.

$ sudo systemctl start nagios

The nagios daemon logs to the /var/log/nagios/nagios.log log file.
