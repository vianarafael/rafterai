If you have a computer that is running as a virtual 
host, you can install Fedora on that system as a virtual guest. Virtualization host 
 software includes KVM, Xen, and VirtualBox (for Linux and UNIX systems, as well as 
Windows and the MAC), Hyper-V (for Microsoft systems), and VMWare (both Linux 
and Microsoft systems).
