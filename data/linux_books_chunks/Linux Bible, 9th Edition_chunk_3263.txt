With passive FTP, the client requests 
the passive connection and requests a random port from the server.

Many browsers support passive FTP mode so that, if the client has a ﬁ rewall, it doesn’t block 
the data port the FTP server might use in active mode. Supporting passive mode requires 
some extra work on the server’s ﬁ rewall to allow random connections to ports above 1023 on 
the server.
