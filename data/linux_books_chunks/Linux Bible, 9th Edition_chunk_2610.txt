To turn on the ip_forward param-
eter immediately and temporarily, type the following as root:

14

# cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
0
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
# cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
1

Packet forwarding (routing) is disabled by default, with the value of ip_forward set to 0. 
By setting it to 1, packet forwarding is immediately enabled.
