Don’t worry if the output doesn’t exactly match what is in your directory at 
this point.

Any ﬁ le or directory beginning with a dot (.) is considered a hidden ﬁ le and is not 
 displayed by default with ls. These dot ﬁ les are typically conﬁ guration ﬁ les or directories 
that need to be in your home directory, but don’t need to be seen in your daily work. The 
-a lets you see those ﬁ les.
