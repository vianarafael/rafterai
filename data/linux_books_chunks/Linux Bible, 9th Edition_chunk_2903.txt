You can use CUPS without modifi ca-
tion by confi guring the Windows computer with a PostScript driver that uses http://printserver-
name:631/printers/targetPrinter as its printing port.

You may also be able to use the native Windows printer drivers for the printer instead of the PostScript 
driver.
