Because only the root user may write to the 
zone file directory, we start our editor using sudo.

$ sudo vim /var/cache/bind/master/example.com.db

We place these authoritive zone files in the master directory. We will be showing you how the slaves 
operate shortly. You will need to make sure that the directory /var/cache/bind/master or /var/named/master 
exists, depending on your distribution.
