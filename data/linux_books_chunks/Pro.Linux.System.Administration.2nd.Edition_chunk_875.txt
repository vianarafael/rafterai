In this case, when executing commands, Linux will look for the command first in the /home/
ataylor/scripts directory before anywhere else on the host.

You can add a directory to the end of the path using the same basic construct:

$ PATH=$PATH:/home/ataylor/scripts

Then when you run a command, Linux will search all the directories in your path, and if a matching 

command or application isnâ€™t found, it will search your suffixed directory.

Any string of the type KEY=value is assumed to be an environment variable assignment by Bash.
