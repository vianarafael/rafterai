We want files to be readable and writable, and for directories we should give full access 
to the specified users and groups but no access for the general public.

force create mode = 0770
force directory mode = 2770
create mask = 0770
directory mask = 2770
force group = sales
force user = exbackup

As you saw in Chapter 4, the permissions here are read, write, and execute/access on all files and 

directories.
