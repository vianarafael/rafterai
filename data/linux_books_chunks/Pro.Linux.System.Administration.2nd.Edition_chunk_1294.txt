To display the IP address information of all the interfaces on a host, we use this command:

$ ip address show

Running the ip command with the address show option displays all interfaces on your host and their 

current status and configuration. We could also use the shortened alias ip addr show.

The foregoing will list all the host interfaces and their addresses.
