nfs

Unix servers often use nfs (aka the network file system) to share directories over the network.
Setting up an nfs server is discussed later. Connecting as a client to an nfs server is done
with mount, and is very similar to connecting to local storage.

This command shows how to connect to the nfs server named server42, which is sharing
the directory /srv/data.
