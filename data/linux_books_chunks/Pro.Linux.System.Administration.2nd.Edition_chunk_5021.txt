You then need to remake GRUB 

with the following:

$ sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2//grub.cfg

Now when you reboot your host, the default scheduler is deadline.

$ cat /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
noop [deadline] cfq

Remember that on Ubuntu grub2-mkconfig needs to be like this:

$ sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub2.cfg

Now your changes will persist across reboots.
