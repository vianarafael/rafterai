You can override the 
default runlevel by putting a different runlevel number at the end of the kernel 
line from the boot menu. To do this, highlight the operating system entry you 
want, type e, highlight the kernel, type e, and add the new runlevel to the end of 
the line (for example, add a space and the number 1 to go into single-user mode).
