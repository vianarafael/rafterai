This is commented out, which means it will use the built-in default, as follows:

# cache_dir ufs /var/spool/squid 100 16 256

The preceding line tells Squid to store cache objects under the /var/spool/squid directory in ufs 
format. It will store a maximum of 100Mb of objects; after that, older objects will be expired from the cache 
and replaced by newer ones.
