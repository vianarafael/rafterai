There is exactly
one SOA record for each zone.

CNAME record

A  CNAME  record  maps  a  hostname  to  a  hostname,  creating  effectively  an  alias  for  an
existing hostname. The name of the mail server is often aliased to mail or smtp, and the
name of a web server to www.

MX record

The MX record points to an smtp server.
