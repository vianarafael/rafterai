Let’s create the file /etc/cron.d/example_nightly_sync and add the 
following:

# run the nightly rsync script at 5 minutes past 12 every morning.
MAILTO=jsmith@example.com
5       0       *       *       *       exbackup 
  /data/backups/bin/nightly_remote_rsync.sh

Here we are setting the script to run every night at five minutes past midnight as the user exbackup.
