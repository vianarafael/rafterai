The task we are going to run is 
called spec:ansible, and that will fire up the Ansible Vagrant host and then run the Serverspec tests.

You can see why the tests failed in the Failures: section.

Failures:

  1) Package "httpd" should be installed
     On host `puppet'
     Failure/Error: it { should be_installed }
       expected Package "httpd" to be installed
       sudo -p 'Password: ' /bin/sh -c rpm\ -q\ httpd
       package httpd is not installed

     # ./spec/puppet/sample_spec.rb:4:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'

You can see that Serverspec tried to run the rpm â€“q httpd command but could not find httpd installed.
