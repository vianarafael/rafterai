Any combination of permissions can result from 0 (no permission) through 
7 (full permission).

Here are some examples of how to change permission on a ﬁ le (named ﬁ le) and what the 
resulting permission would be:

The following chmod command results in this permission: rwxrwxrwx

# chmod 777 file

The following chmod command results in this permission: rwxr-xr-x

# chmod 755 file

The following chmod command results in this permission: rw-r--r--

# chmod 644 file rw-r--r-

The following chmod command results in this permission: ---------

# chmod 000 file

The chmod command also can be used recursively.
