samba howto

Samba  comes  with  excellent  documentation  in  html  and  pdf  format  (and  also  as  a  free
download from samba.org and it is for sale as a printed book).

The documentation is a separate package, so install it if you want it on the server itself.

[root@centos6 ~]# yum install samba-doc
...
[root@centos6 ~]# ls -l /usr/share/doc/samba-doc-3.5.10/
