Advanced settings for the user JSmith

In the advanced settings we can configure things like the users’ home directory, their user and group IDs, 

and what groups they are members of. In this example they are given access to the “wheel” group. This is the 
group that gives them equivalent “root” access. We talk more about these advanced settings in Chapter 5.

That is the last installation step.
