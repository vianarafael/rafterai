gateway          IN    CNAME     ns.example.com.
headoffice       IN    CNAME     au-mel-ubuntu-1.example.com.
smtp             IN    CNAME     mail.example.com.
pop              IN    CNAME     mail.example.com.
imap             IN    CNAME     mail.example.com.
www              IN    CNAME     au-mel-ubuntu-1.example.com.
sql              IN    CNAME     au-mel-ubuntu-1.example.com.

Weâ€™ve also created CNAMEs called gateway and headoffice, which we will use when we set up a Virtual 

Private Network in Chapter 15.
