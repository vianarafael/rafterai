Checking /etc/yum.conf
When any yum command starts, it checks the ﬁ le /etc/yum.conf for default settings. The 
/etc/yum.conf ﬁ le is the basic YUM conﬁ guration ﬁ le. You can also identify the  location 
of repositories here, although the /etc/yum.repos.d directory is the more  typical location 
for identifying repositories.
