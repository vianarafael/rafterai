For example, a login prompt for the user named jake 
on a computer named pine with /usr/share/ as the current working directory would 
appear as

[jake@pine share]$

You can change the prompt to display any characters you like and even read in pieces of 
information about your systemâ€”for example, you can use the current working directory, 
the date, the local computer name, or any string of characters as your prompt.
