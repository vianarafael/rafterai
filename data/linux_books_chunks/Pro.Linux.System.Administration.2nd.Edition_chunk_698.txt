always back up 
files before you edit, move, or delete them. sometimes it is better to move the file or directory, wait for a period,

On Linux hosts, you can also create links to files. Links can be used like Windows shortcuts but come in two 
forms—hard links and soft, or symbolic, links. Hard links are not like Windows shortcuts.
