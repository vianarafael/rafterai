Using the htpasswd Command

$ sudo htpasswd -c /etc/nagios/passwd jsmith
New password:
Re-type new password:
Adding password for user jsmith

The htpasswd command has two variables: the location of the file that holds our usernames and 

passwords and the username of the user. We also use a command-line switch, -c. The -c switch is used 
when you first create a password file.
