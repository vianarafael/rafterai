A target can start a set 
of services, as well as create or start other types of units (such as directory mounts, 
sockets, swap areas, and timers).

 ■ System V compatibility—There are targets that align with System V runlevels, if 
you are used to dealing with runlevels. For example, graphical.target aligns 
with runlevel 5 while multi-user.target is essentially runlevel 3.
