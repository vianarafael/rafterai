We’ll also make use of 
Transport Layer Security (TLS), a form of encryption that can be used to encrypt your e-mail, and talk about 
SMTP AUTH, which is a way to authenticate your users when they send e-mail.

We’re going to use the headoffice.example.com host as our e-mail server, and our gateway.example.com 
will pass e-mail traffic through to that host, as we described in our example network configuration in Chapter 7.

Our mail server will be called mail.example.com (which is a DNS CNAME we created in Chapter 10) 

and have an internal IP address of 192.168.0.1.
