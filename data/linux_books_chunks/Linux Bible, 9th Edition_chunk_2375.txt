The following is an example of some of the rules in the RULES section 
of the /etc/rsyslog.conf ﬁ le (note that in Ubuntu, you need to look in the 
/etc/rsyslog.d directory for this conﬁ guration information):

#### RULES ####
# Log all kernel messages to the console.
# Logging much else clutters up the screen.
#kern.*                                        /dev/console
# Log anything (except mail) of level info or higher.
# Don't log private authentication messages!
*.info;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none       /var/log/messages
# The authpriv file has restricted access.
authpriv.*                                     /var/log/secure
# Log all the mail messages in one place.
mail.*                                         -/var/log/maillog
# Log cron stuff
cron.*                                         /var/log/cron

Rules entries come in two columns.
