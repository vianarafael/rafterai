Tools like ufw and firewalld are both user tools to manage firewalls and they attempt to do this in a logical 
and sane way and hide the complexity of the rules for you.

A default rule set for just the filter table for firewalld or ufw can be over 100 lines long, Listing 7-8 shows 

the output (iptables-save) of just the INPUT chain of the filter table on a CentOS host that has firewalld 
installed.
