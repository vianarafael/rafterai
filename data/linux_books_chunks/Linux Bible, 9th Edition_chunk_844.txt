With an s appearing within either the owner 
(-rwsr-xr-x) or group (-rwxr-sr-x) permissions, or both (-rwsr-sr-x), 
the application can be run by any user, but ownership of the running process is 
assigned to the applicationâ€™s user/group instead of that of the user launching the 
command. This is referred to as a set UID or set GID program, respectively.
