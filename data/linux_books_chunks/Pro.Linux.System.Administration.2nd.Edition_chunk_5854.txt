We are now going to write the Ansible code to install it and 
have it provisioned on our Vagrant host.

$ vi ansible/playbooks/ansible.yml
---
- hosts: all
  gather_facts: true
  become: true
  tasks:
  - name: install apache2
     apt: name=apache2 state=latest

We will do the same for Puppet now too.

$ vi manifests/site.pp
class httpd {

  package {'httpd': ensure => 'latest' }

}

include httpd

We are going to provision our hosts now using the vagrant provision command.
