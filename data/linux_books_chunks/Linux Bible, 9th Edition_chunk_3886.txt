If you are looking for a stable 
 system, Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a better bet because it provides updates for 
each major release for seven years or more.

If you use the apt-get command in Ubuntu to update your packages, keep in mind that there are different 
 meanings to the update and upgrade options in Ubuntu with apt-get than with the yum command 
(Fedora and RHEL).

In Ubuntu, apt-get update causes the latest packaging metadata (package names, version numbers, and 
so on) to be downloaded to the local system.
