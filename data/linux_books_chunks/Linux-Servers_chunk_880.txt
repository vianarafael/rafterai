So our address can from above can be shortened to:

fe80::a00:27ff:fe8e:8aa8

This :: can only occur once! The following is not a valid ipv6 address:

fe80::20:2e4f::39ac

The ipv6 localhost address is 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001, which can be
abbreviated to ::1.

paul@debian5:~/github/lt/images$ /sbin/ifconfig lo | grep inet6
          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host
