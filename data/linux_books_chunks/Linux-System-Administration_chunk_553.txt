This means that you can have local SCSI
devices (like /dev/sdb) without having the storage hardware in the local computer.

The  computer  holding  the  physical  storage  hardware  is  called  the  iSCSI  Target.  Each
individual addressable iSCSI device on the target server will get a LUN number.

The iSCSI client computer that is connecting to the Target server is called an Initiator.
