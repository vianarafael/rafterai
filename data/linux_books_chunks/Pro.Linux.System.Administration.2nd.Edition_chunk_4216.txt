You can see in the previous Running Jobs output the JobId to use.

*cancel jobid=1

The cancel command can be run without arguments and will automatically select the JobId for you 

(if only one job is running; otherwise, it presents a list to choose from). We have run the job again, this time 
without canceling it, and it has completed.
