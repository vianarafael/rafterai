If we remember what we learned back 
in Chapter 4, the umask is an octet and is used to set permissions on files and directories. When applied it 
means we give files created by this process permissions of 0711, or rwx-x-x. This means that the owner of 
the process is given read, write, and execute permission on the files, the group and everyone else will have 
execute only.
