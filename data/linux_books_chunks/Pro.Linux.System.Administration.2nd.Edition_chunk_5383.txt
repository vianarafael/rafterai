Simple Remote Monitoring

You can create a variety of network-based services using Nagios plug-ins, but what if you want to monitor 
services that aren’t network facing or on the local host? One of the methods to do this is a special plug-in 
called check_by_ssh (for others, see the “Remote Monitoring” sidebar).

The check_by_ssh plug-in uses SSH to connect to a remote host and execute a command.
