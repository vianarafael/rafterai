dns is used by many network
services to translate names into network addresses and to locate services on the network
(by name).

Whenever you visit a web site, send an e-mail, log on to Active Directory, play Minecraft,
chat, or use VoIP, there will be one or (many) more queries to dns services.

Should dns fail at your organization, then the whole network will grind to a halt (unless you
hardcoded the network addresses).

You will notice that even the largest of organizations benefit greatly from having one dns
infrastructure.
