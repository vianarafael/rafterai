minimal smb.conf

Below is an example of a very minimalistic smb.conf. It allows samba to start, and to be
visible to other computers (Microsoft shows computers in Network Neighborhood or My
Network Places).

[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ cat /etc/samba/smb.conf
[global]
workgroup = WORKGROUP
[firstshare]
path = /srv/samba/public
