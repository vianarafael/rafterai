This is usually when the e-mail has been sent from a bogus domain, as is often the case with 
spam e-mail.

We can protect our e-mail server from becoming a relay server by adding the following:

$ sudo postconf –e 'smtpd_relay_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, permit_sasl_authenticated, 
reject_unauth_destination'

Here we are saying that we will permit any specified networks (permit_mynetworks) to send mail to 

other destination mail servers.
