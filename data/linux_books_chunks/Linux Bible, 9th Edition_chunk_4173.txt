For example, to follow kernel messages or httpd messages 
as they come in, add the -f option (press Ctrl+C when you are Ô¨Å nished):

# journalctl -k -f
# journalctl -f -u NetworkManager.service

To check only boot messages, you can list the boot IDs for all system boots and then boot 
the particular boot instance that interests you.
