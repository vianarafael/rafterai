By setting the sticky bit on a directory, the 
directory’s owner can allow other users and groups to add ﬁ les to the directory, 
but prevent users from deleting each other’s ﬁ les in that directory. With a set GID 
assigned to a directory, any ﬁ les created in that directory are assigned the same 
group as the directory’s group.
