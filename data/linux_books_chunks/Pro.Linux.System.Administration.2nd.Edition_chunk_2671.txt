The instructions here for Ubuntu should work the same for CentOS: 
www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/installing-the-linux-dynamic-update-client-on-ubuntu/.

Of course, many home/business firewall routers also support dynamic dns updating and may be a 

better choice if you have one.

Dynamic DNS is not to be confused with local dynamic dns updates, which is in principle similar but 

different.
