GIDs also range from 0 to 65535, with the root user also 
always having a GID of 0.

If you run the id command for the root user, you can see the results on the following line:

$ id root
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

This shows the root user having a UID of 0 and a GID of 0.

 each user and group on a host must have a unique UId and GId.
