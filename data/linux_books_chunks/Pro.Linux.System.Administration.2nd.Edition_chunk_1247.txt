In this chapter, we will describe how to set up your host’s networking and then 
how to protect that network from attackers using a firewall.

 ■ Note 

 A firewall is a series of rules that control access to your host through the network.

We will teach you about how to configure your network cards or interfaces and how to give them IP 
(Internet Protocol) addresses.
