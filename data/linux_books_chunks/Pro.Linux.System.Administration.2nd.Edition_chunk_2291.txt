note that performance in this configuration will be quite slow, as data will need to be written to 
different parts of the same disk multiple times. It also doesnâ€™t provide much additional resilience against disk 
failures. If the single disk fails, then your raId array will also fail.

On our example host we will again use three new disks, sdc, sdd, and sde, all of identical size.
