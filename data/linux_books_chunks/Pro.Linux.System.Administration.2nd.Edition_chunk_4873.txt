dstat output

So far it’s not that much different from vmstat, except that we have disk reads and writes calculated for 
us, and we also we have network send and receive information. The CPU, paging, and system are the same 
as vmstat.

Let’s suppose that we have noticed that our application is performing poorly and we think it is due to 

disk performance.
