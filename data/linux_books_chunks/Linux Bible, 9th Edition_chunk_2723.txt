A service unit is for managing daemons on your 
Linux server. A target unit is simply a group of other units.

The example that follows shows several systemd service units and target units. The 
 service units have familiar daemon names, such as cups and sshd. Note that each ser-
vice unit name ends with .service. The target units shown have names like sysinit.
