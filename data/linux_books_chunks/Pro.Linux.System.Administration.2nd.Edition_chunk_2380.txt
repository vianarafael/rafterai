Once you know the location of a backup superblock, you can try running e2fsck and specifying the 

location of a backup superblock using the -b option.

$ sudo e2fsck -b 98304 -y /dev/sdg1
e2fsck 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)
/dev/sdg1 was not cleanly unmounted, check forced.
Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
Pass 2: Checking directory structure
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity
Pass 4: Checking reference counts
Pass 5: Checking group summary information

/dev/sdg1: ***** FILE SYSTEM WAS MODIFIED *****
/dev/sdg1: 11/524288 files (0.0% non-contiguous), 70287/2096891 blocks

The e2fsck command can now run and repair the filesystem.
If there are problems and file data is found in inodes that e2fsck cannot place, this data will be stored in 

files in the lost+found directory on the filesystem youâ€™re checking.
