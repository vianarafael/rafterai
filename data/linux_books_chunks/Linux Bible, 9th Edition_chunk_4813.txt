All modiﬁ cations must be saved to the 
iptables conﬁ guration ﬁ le, /etc/sysconfig/iptables, because this is the ﬁ le used 
at system boot to load the ﬁ rewall.

In the example that follows, the modiﬁ cations made earlier are still in the ﬁ rewall. Before 
they are saved to the conﬁ guration ﬁ le, a backup copy of the original ﬁ le is made. This is 
always a good idea.
