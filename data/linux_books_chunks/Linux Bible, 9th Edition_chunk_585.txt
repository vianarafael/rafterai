Virtual consoles are a way to have multiple shell sessions open at once in 
addition to the graphical interface you are using.

You can switch between virtual consoles by holding the Ctrl and Alt keys and pressing a 
function key between F1 and F6. For example, in Fedora, press Ctrl+Alt+F1 (or F2, F3, F4, 
and so on up to F6 on most Linux systems) to display one of seven virtual consoles.
