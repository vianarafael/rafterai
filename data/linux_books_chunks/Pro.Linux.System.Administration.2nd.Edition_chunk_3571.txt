You can also use an external validator service like this:

echo 'hello' | mail check-auth@verifier.port25.com

SPF settings and e-mail a detailed report to you.

Unlike what you’ve seen in most of the earlier sections of this chapter, your users aren’t going to be directly 
accessing their e-mail via the command line.
