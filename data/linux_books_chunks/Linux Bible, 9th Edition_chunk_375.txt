If you were to launch an X client (such as a 
 terminal window or word processor), it would appear on the X display with no border around 
it to move, minimize, or close the window. Those features are added by a window manager.

A window manager adds the capability to manage the windows on your desktop and often 
provides menus for launching applications and otherwise working with the desktop.
