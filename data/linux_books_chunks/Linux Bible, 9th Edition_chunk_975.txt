Here are some basic examples of using the 
find command:

$ find
$ find /etc
# find /etc
$ find $HOME -ls

Run on a line by itself, the find command ﬁ nds all ﬁ les and directories below the current 
directory. If you want to search from a particular point in the directory tree, just add the 
name of the directory you want to search (such as /etc).
