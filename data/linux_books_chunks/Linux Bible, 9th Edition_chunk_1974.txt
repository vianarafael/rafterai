If the ﬁ lesystem were already mounted, I could 
type the following mount command as root to remount the ﬁ lesystem, using acl or any 
other values added to the /etc/fstab ﬁ le:

# mount -o remount /dev/sdc1

A third way you can add ACL support to a ﬁ lesystem is to mount the ﬁ lesystem by hand 
and speciﬁ cally request the acl mount option.
