The -t option displays ﬁ les in the order in which they were most recently modiﬁ ed. With 
the -F option, a backslash (/) appears at the end of directory names, an asterisk (*) is 
added to executable ﬁ les, and an at sign (@) is shown next to symbolic links.

To show hidden and non-hidden ﬁ les:

$ ls -a
