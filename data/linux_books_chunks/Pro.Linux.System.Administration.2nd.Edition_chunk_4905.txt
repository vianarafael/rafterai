We want to collect 

metrics for each network interface except the localhost or loopback interface.

<Plugin load>
    ReportRelative true
</Plugin>

<Plugin memory>
    ValuesAbsolute true
    ValuesPercentage false
</Plugin>

The previous are the defaults for memory and load and are similar to other system metrics we are 

gathering.

<Plugin mysql>
    <Database no_db>
        Host "localhost"
        Port "3306"
        User “monitor"
        Password “monitorpasswd"
        ConnectTimeout 10
        InnodbStats true
    </Database>
</Plugin>

The mysql plug-in will work just as good with our MariaDB server.
