To begin exploring the SSL 
conﬁ guration for your Apache web server, make sure the mod_ssl package is installed on 
the server running your Apache (httpd) service:

# yum install mod_ssl

The mod_ssl package includes the module needed to implement SSL on your web server 
(mod_ssl.so) and a conﬁ g ﬁ le for your SSL hosts: /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf.
