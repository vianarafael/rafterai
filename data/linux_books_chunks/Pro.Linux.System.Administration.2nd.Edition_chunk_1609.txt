We are going to add enp0s9 to this interface and like we said, 

the interface needs to ‘upped’ again.

$ sudo nmcli c up enp0s9

You should now be able to reach the HTTPS web service running on the enp0s9 interface.

Using the ufw Command
Ubuntu also has a tool for manipulating firewall rules from the command line.
