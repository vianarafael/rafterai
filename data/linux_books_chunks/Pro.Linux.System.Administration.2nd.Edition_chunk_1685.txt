The virbr0 interface is used for virtual interfaces to shared physical 
devices. Lines 8-9 are similar and provide access the bootps (DHCP) service. These rules allow virtual hosts 
that maybe started up (KVM or Xen virtual hosts, for example) to access these services to get DNS and DHCP 
services. We talk more about KVM and Xen in Chapter 20.
