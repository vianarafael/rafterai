For example, if you wanted to Ô¨Å nd the location of 
the chage command, you could type the following:

$ locate chage
/usr/bin/chage
/usr/sbin/lchage
/usr/share/man/fr/man1/chage.1.gz
/usr/share/man/it/man1/chage.1.gz
/usr/share/man/ja/man1/chage.1.gz
/usr/share/man/man1/chage.1.gz
/usr/share/man/man1/lchage.1.gz
/usr/share/man/pl/man1/chage.1.gz
/usr/share/man/ru/man1/chage.1.gz
/usr/share/man/sv/man1/chage.1.gz
/usr/share/man/tr/man1/chage.1.gz

Notice that locate not only found the chage command, but also found the lchage 
command and a variety of man pages associated with chage for different languages.
