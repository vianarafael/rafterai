There 

are two ways a carbon-relay can be used, for sharding requests (using consistent hashing) to multiple 
backends and for replication, sending metrics to any number of different carbon-cache servers or 
aggregators.

Carbon-aggregators are used to buffer metrics that are destined for the carbon-cache to help reduce 
I/O.
