Listing 8-11 tells us that the package bash is responsible for the file /bin/bash, and it also informs us of the 

version number of the installed bash package (you can also use the shorter format of $ rpm -qf /bin/bash).
So now we know that bash provided that file, but what other files on our system belong to the bash 
package? Armed with the information from --whatprovides, we can see what other files belong to the bash 
package by using the --query --list options as shown in Listing 8-12.
