Metacharacters can help you match one or more ﬁ les 
without completely typing each ﬁ le name. Operators enable you to direct information from 
one command or ﬁ le to another command or ﬁ le.

Using fi le-matching metacharacters
To save you some keystrokes and to enable you to refer easily to a group of ﬁ les, the bash 
shell lets you use metacharacters.
