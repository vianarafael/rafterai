Red Hat created the RPM packaging format so a 
 software package could contain not only the ﬁ les to be shared, but also  information 
about the package version, who created it, which ﬁ les were documentation or 
 conﬁ guration ﬁ les, and when it was created. By installing software packaged in 
RPM format, that information about each software package could be stored in a 
local RPM database.
