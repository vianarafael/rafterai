every time the host is rebooted, an entry is logged that 
gives the time of the reboot and the version of the kernel into which the host was booted.

the lastb command produces the same style of report but lists only those logins that were “bad.” 
In other words, it lists those logins in which an incorrect password was entered, or some other error 
resulted in a failure to log in.

related to the last and lastb commands is the lastlog command.
