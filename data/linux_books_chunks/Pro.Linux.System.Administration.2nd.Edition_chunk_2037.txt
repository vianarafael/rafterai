./configure: error: the HTTP gzip module requires the zlib library.
You can either disable the module by using --without-http_gzip_module
option, or install the zlib library into the system, or build the zlib library
statically from the source with nginx by using --with-zlib=<path> option.

The configure script checks our system for the presence of a compiler, required header files, and 
definitions of functions and data structures in these header files.
