Possible values are:
#      targeted - Only targeted network daemons are protected.
#      strict - Full SELinux protection.
SELINUXTYPE=mls

Do not be fooled by the out-of-date comments in the SELinux confi guration fi le. You cannot set SELINUXTYPE to 
strict in newer Linux distributions. If you do, the system hangs on the next reboot and you must use grub com-
mands to fi x the problem.
