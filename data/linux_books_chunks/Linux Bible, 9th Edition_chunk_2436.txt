Basic tasks that 
apply to all servers include using networking tools (particularly SSH tools) to log in, copy 
ﬁ les, or execute remote commands.

Because an administrator can’t be logged in watching servers all the time, tools for 
 gathering data and reviewing the log data later are very important when administering 
Linux servers. The rsyslog facility can be used for local and remote logging.
