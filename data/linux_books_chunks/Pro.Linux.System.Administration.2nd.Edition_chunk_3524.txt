The package installation process also creates a cron 
entry (in the /etc/cron.daily directory) for the FreshClam update tool that updates ClamAVâ€™s signatures 
once a day.

On Ubuntu, the ClamAV daemon is configured via the /etc/clamav/clamd.conf configuration file and 
the freshclam update daemon via the /etc/clamav/freshclam.conf configuration file.
