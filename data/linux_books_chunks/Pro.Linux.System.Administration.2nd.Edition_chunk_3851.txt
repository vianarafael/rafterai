CUPS also comes with a web UI that we will use to add and share our 
printer.

When you plug in your printer, the kernel will send an event notice to both Udev and the Hardware 
Abstraction Level (HAL) manager. Udev is a user-space device management application, and HAL provides 
a consistent interface for the desktop programs.
