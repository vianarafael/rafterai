In each of the  server-related 
chapters that follow this chapter, youâ€™ll go through the same basic steps for getting that server 
started and available to be used by your clients.

Step 1: Install the server
Although most server software is not preinstalled on the typical Linux system, any general-
purpose Linux system offers the software packages needed to supply every major type of 
server available.

Sometimes, multiple software packages associated with a particular type of server are 
 gathered together in Package Groups (sometimes called Package Collections).
