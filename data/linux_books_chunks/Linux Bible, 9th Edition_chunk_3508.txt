Here is what the default homes entry 
looks like:

[homes]
        comment = Home Directories
        browseable = no
        writable = yes
;       valid users = %S
;       valid users = MYDOMAIN\%S

Notice that two examples of valid users entries are commented out. With this value not 
set (as it is by default), any valid users can log in to Samba.
