You can now use the ldapadd 

command to add the created LDIF into our SLAPD server.

$ sudo ldapadd -Q -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -f schema/exampleactive.ldif
adding new entry "cn={5}exampleactive,cn=schema,cn=config"

We will use the exampleactive.schema file when we declare our users in the “LDIFs and Adding Users” 

section of this chapter.

Access Control Lists
Every connection that accesses your LDAP server has to be given specific access to various parts of the tree if 
you want it to be secure.
