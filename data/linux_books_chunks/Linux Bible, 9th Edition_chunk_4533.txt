However, a mes-
sage is sent to a log ﬁ le denoting that access should have been denied.

SELinux Permissive mode is used for the following:

 ■ Auditing the current SELinux policy rules

 ■ Testing new applications to see what effect SELinux policy rules will have on them

 ■ Testing new SELinux policy rules to see what effect the new rules will have on 

 current services and applications

 ■ Troubleshooting why a particular service or application is no longer working prop-

erly under SELinux

In some cases, you can use the audit2allow command to read the SELinux audit logs and 
generate new SELinux rules to selectively allow the denied actions.
