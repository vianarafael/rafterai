These files are the way Linux makes hardware devices, such 
as hard disk drives, USBs, and DVD drives, accessible from within the operating system. Most, but not all, of 
the devices in a host are represented by files in the /dev directory.

The /dev directory is a special directory thatâ€™s populated by a service called udev.
