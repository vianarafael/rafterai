Though this might 
seem a trivial issue, having system clocks match means your log entries will all carry consistent timestamps. 
This in turn means you can easily correlate log entries from different hosts, should the need arise. 
Synchronized system clocks are also a prerequisite for the functionality weâ€™ll be enabling later.
