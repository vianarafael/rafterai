However, since this is UDP, remembering that UDP is a fire-and-forget 
protocol, there is no guarantee that the server at the other end will receive it.

To get around this and prevent possible message loss, we would use RELP, which is the reliable event 

logging protocol (see www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/configuration/modules/omrelp.html).

*.*    :omrelp:backup.example.com:2514

Of course, we need to load the module in the module section of our rsyslog.conf file, and we will show 

how to configure RELP shortly.

selections and filtering.
