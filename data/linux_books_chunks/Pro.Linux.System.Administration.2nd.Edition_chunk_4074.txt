Bareos and 
Bacula have since diverged significantly in features but still remain similar in configuration and installation. In 
most instances, in this section you could swap Bareos for Bacula and you would be fine for configuring either.
Bareos works on the client/server model and requires a Bareos client installed on the target host to be 

backed up.
