$ sudo nmcli d status
DEVICE  TYPE      STATE                                  CONNECTION
enp0s3  ethernet  connected                              enp0s3
lo      loopback  unmanaged                              --

The nmcli command takes the following format:

$ nmcli <OPTIONS> <OBJECT> <COMMAND|HELP>

So if you need help to remember how to use the add command on the connection object you can type

$ nmcli connection add help
Usage: nmcli connection add { ARGUMENTS | help }
....

What we are going to do next is add a team interface to our CentOS host.
