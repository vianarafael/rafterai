Every host that uses the template 
basic-ssh-checks will get the Current Load service because they share the same hostgroup.

Taking a look at our service definition closer, we can see that we have declared it like this:

define service{
         use                              local-service
         hostgroup_name         linux-group
         service_description     Current Load
         check_command         check_load_ssh!5.0,4.0,3.0!10.0,6.0,4.0
        }

Our service, called Current Load, executes the check_load_ssh command and passes two arguments, 

which specify the average load over the 1-, 5-, and 15-minute intervals required to trigger a WARNING or 
CRITICAL status.

 We discussed load in Chapter 17.

Finally in Listing 18-21 we have the host definition for the gateway server.
