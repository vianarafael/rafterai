Is  the  sysinit  script  on  your  computers  setting  or  changing  the  PATH  environment
variable ?

On Red Hat, grep for PATH in /etc/rc.sysinit, on Debian/Ubuntu check /etc/rc.local and /
etc/ini.t/rc.local. The answer is probably no, but on RHEL5 the rc.sysinit script does set
the HOSTNAME variable.

[root@RHEL5 etc]# grep HOSTNAME rc.sysinit
