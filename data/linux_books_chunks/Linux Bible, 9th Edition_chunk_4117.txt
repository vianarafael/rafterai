For instance, the rainbow table would contain the hash 
for the popular password “Password,” which is:

$6$dhN5ZMUj$CNghjYIteau5xl8yX.f6PTOpendJwTOcXjlTDQUQZhhy
V8hKzQ6Hxx6Egj8P3VsHJ8Qrkv.VSR5dxcK3QhyMc.

Because of the ease of access to the password hashes in the /etc/passwd ﬁ le, it is only a 
matter of time before a hashed password is matched in a rainbow table and the plaintext 
password uncovered.

Security experts will tell you that the passwords are not just hashed, but they are also salted.
