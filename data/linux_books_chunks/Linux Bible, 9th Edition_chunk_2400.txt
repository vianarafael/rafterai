Unless you expect to log in to the server to read logwatch 
messages, you probably want to change the MailTo setting in the /etc/logwatch/conf/
logwatch.conf Ô¨Å le:

13

MailTo = chris@example.com

Look in /usr/share/logwatch/default.conf/logwatch.conf for other settings to 
change (such as detail level or the time range for each report).
