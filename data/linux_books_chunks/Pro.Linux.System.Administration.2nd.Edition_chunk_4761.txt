Having several 
Linux hosts with several user accounts on each can become cumbersome to manage. Passwords can get 
out of sync, and you might not remove users when they leave your company from all your hosts, creating 
potential security risks. To simplify this kind of user management, you could centralize your authentication 
service by pointing your Linux hosts to your LDAP server.
