Create three users (on the Linux and on the samba), remember their passwords!

useradd -c 'SMB user1' userx

passwd userx

2. Set up a shared directory that is only accessible to authenticated users.

The shared section in smb.conf could look like this:

[authwrite]
 path = /srv/samba/authwrite
 comment = authenticated users only
 read only = no  
 guest ok = no
