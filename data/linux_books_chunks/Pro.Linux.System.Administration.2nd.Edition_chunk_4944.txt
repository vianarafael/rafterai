In this scenario 
our hosts will send their metrics to our relay.example.com host on port 2013 (which is a line-delimited 
receiver). From there we will send the metrics on to our monitor.example.com host, which has a carbon-
cache daemon listening on port 2004.

Configuring a carbon-relay requires a carbon.conf file and a file called relay-rules.conf.
