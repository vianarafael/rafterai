For example, let’s say you had a shell script named myscript that 
contained the following:

#!/bin/bash
# Script to echo out command-line arguments
echo "The first argument is $1, the second is $2."
echo “The command itself is called $0.”

Assuming the script is executable and located in a directory in your $PATH, the following 
shows what would happen if you ran that command with foo and bar as arguments:

$ chmod 755 /home/chris/bin/myscript
$ myscript foo bar
The first argument is foo, the second is bar.
The command itself is called /home/chris/bin/myscript.

As you can see, the positional parameter $0 is the full path or relative path to myscript, 
$1 is foo, and $2 is bar.

Another variable, $#, tells you how many parameters your script was given.
