Check this page for the most 
up to date status of the filesystem: https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Status.

 â–  Note  Btrfs is not the only large-scale filesystem, but it is the one that is available in the default install of 
Linux. others like ZFS are also popular and performant, but ZFS cannot be redistributed due to its license  
(it cannot be part of a Linux distribution).
