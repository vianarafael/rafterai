If you use the mount command and only pass the 

mount point as a parameter, it will check the /etc/fstab file for a matching entry and mount that, with the 
options specified in the file.

$ sudo mount /mnt/data

If the mount command exited without printing any errors, the fstab entry is correct and your filesystem 

will be automatically mounted each time you boot your host.
