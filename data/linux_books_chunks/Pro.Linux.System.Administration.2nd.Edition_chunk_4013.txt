Standard-IA also has 
a minimum object size of 128Kb, which means objects smaller than that will not be transitioned and will be 
deleted after the year is up. Also, once we have transitioned the files into Standard-IA, they need to remain 
there for 30 days before we can transition them to another tier like Glacier.
