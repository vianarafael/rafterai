We can test that our API is working correctly 

with the following:

$ curl -H 'Host: monitor' http://127.0.0.1:80/metrics/find?query=*
[{"text": "carbon", "expandable": 1, "allowChildren": 1, "id": "carbon", "leaf": 0}, 
{"text": "relay", "expandable": 1, "allowChildren": 1, "id": "relay", "leaf": 0}]

This shows that we can contact the Nginx web server, and that will make a request to the back-end 

Gunicorn service that will return our query request for our metrics.
