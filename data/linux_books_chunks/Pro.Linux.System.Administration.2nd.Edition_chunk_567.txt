We discuss these in the sidebar “setuid, setgid, and sticky permissions” later in this 
chapter.

Read permissions allow a file to be read or viewed but not edited. If it is set on a directory, the names of 
the files in the directory can be read, but other details, like their permissions and size, are not visible. Write 
permissions allow you to make changes or write to a file.
