I
created a little script on both machines to configure the interfaces.

root@left~# cat leftnet.sh
pkill dhclient
ifconfig eth0 192.168.60.8 netmask 255.255.255.0

root@right~# cat rightnet.sh
pkill dhclient
ifconfig eth0 192.168.70.9 netmask 255.255.255.0

2.  Set  up  a  third  Linux  computer  with  three  network  cards,  one  on  leftnet,  the  other  on
rightnet.
