If a
field contains an asterisk (*), then this means all values of that field.

The following example means : run script42 eight minutes after two, every day of the month,
every month and every day of the week.

8 14 * * * script42

Run script8472 every month on the first of the month at 25 past midnight.

25 0 1 * * script8472

Run this script33 every two minutes on Sunday (both 0 and 7 refer to Sunday).

*/2 * * * 0

Instead of these five fields, you can also type one of these: @reboot, @yearly or @annually,
@monthly, @weekly, @daily or @midnight, and @hourly.
