The KeepAlive settings determine how Apache deals with longer-running 
sessions. Instead of creating new TCP connections for sessions, you can specify that the Apache server 
should use the same TCP connection. You can fine-tune these settings with MaxKeepAliveRequests and 
KeepAliveTimeout.

The different MPMs also have ways to tune their performance.
