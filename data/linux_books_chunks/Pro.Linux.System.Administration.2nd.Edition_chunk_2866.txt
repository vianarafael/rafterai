Traditionally, Debian (and Ubuntu) system administrators tend to put service-related files in the /srv 
directory. In this example we are not going to follow that idiom, but there is no reason why you cannot 
place web server files in the /srv/www or /var/local directory or any other place on the filesystem that 
makes sense.
