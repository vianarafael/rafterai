We expect to see exactly (...){3} of these:

([0-9]{1,3}[\.]){3}

We then expect to see one more set of octets not followed by a dot.

([0-9]{1,3}[\.]){3}[0-9]{1,3}

putting this all together will in fact match any IP address from 000.000.000.000 to 999.999.999.999 
which we know is technically wrong but chosen because it is clearer to explain as to match only on 
numbers between 0 and 255 is a more complex and long regular expression (but widely documented on 
the Internet).

another useful grep regular expression is searching for e-mail addresses in the mail log.

egrep -o "[A-Za-z0-9._-]+@example.com" /var/log/mail.log

here you can see that we are using the egrep command, which just executes grep with the –E flag.
