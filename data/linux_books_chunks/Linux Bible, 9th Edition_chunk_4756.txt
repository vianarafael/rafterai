You can ﬁ ne-tune the rules to allow 
network trafﬁ c from one location but not from another. These rules essentially make 
up a network access control list for your Linux server.

Fedora, RHEL, and other Linux distributions have added the firewalld service on 
top of iptables, to provide a more dynamic way of managing ﬁ rewall rules.
