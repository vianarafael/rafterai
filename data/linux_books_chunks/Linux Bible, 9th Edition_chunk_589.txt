The 
last ﬁ eld in that entry shows that the bash shell (/bin/bash) is your default shell (the 
one that starts up when you log in or open a Terminal window).

It’s possible, although not likely, that you might have a different default shell set. To try a 
different shell, simply type the name of that shell (examples include ksh, tcsh, csh, sh, 
dash, and others, assuming they are installed).
