So the local server will use the root hints to send an iterative query to a root server.

The  root  server  will  reply  with  a  reference  to  the  server  that  is  authoritative  for  the  .be
domain (root DNS servers do not resolve fqdn's, and root servers do not respond to recursive
queries).

The local server will then sent an iterative query to the authoritative server for the .be tld.
This  server  will  respond  with  a  reference  to  the  name  server  that  is  authoritative  for  the
linux-training.be domain.

The local server will then sent the query for www.linux-training.be to the authoritative server
(or one of its slave servers) for the linux-training.be domain.
