Pretending that we want to send metrics from backup.example.com to a different 
carbon-cache, we could do the following:

[backup_example]
pattern = ^collectd_backup_example_com\.*
destination = 192.168.0.250:2004
continue = true

We would need to add 192.168.0.250 to the DESTINATIONS field in the carbon.conf file.
You can start and stop your carbon-relay service like this on CentOS:

$ sudo systemctl start carbon-relay

and like this for Ubuntu where we pass the instance name to the systemd service:

$ sudo systemctl start carbon-relay@default

Now we need to make our changes to the Collectd configuration to send metrics to our carbon-relay.
