Our head office is the OpenVPN server with an IP address of 10.8.0.1. Each 
branch office has an IP address from that range—for example, you’ve seen the 10.8.0.6 IP address assigned to 
the branch1.example.com office.

Currently through our VPN tunnel, however, we can reach only the IP address 10.8.0.1.
