We are going to install that rpm now using rpm –ivh.

$ sudo rpm –i RPMS/x86_64/simple_echo-1.0-1.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm

Now we can test that the script is installed and working correctly:

$ simple_echo.sh hello
hello

It should be pointed out that creating your own packages from source can take some time depending on 
the complexity of the package you are trying to build and the number of dependencies it has.
