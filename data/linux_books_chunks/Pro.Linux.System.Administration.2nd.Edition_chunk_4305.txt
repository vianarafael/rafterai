The value 120 indicates the time in seconds that OpenVPN will wait 
for a response. If no response is received within 120 seconds, then OpenVPN will assume the connection is 
down and notify us.

Then weâ€™ve added some logging functions. The first is log-append, which tells OpenVPN to log to the /
var/log/openvpn.log file.
