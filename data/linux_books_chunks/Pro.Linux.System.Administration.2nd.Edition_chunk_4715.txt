You can also pass in 

other options that allow you to test access against such things as peernames and ssf.

One of the other useful ways to figure out what is going on with your access control lists, which can be 

hard to get right, is to have the following in your access control list while you are testing:

access to * by * search

You can combine this with modifying the logging configuration in your SLAPD, changing your log level to 

something like this:

olcLogLevel:  416

This will show the search filter and the access control list processing as well as connection management 
and configuration file processing.
