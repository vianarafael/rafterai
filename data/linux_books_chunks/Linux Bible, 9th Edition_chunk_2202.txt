Although this is most useful for creating 
ﬁ lesystems on hard-disk partitions, you can create ﬁ lesystems on USB ﬂ ash drives, ﬂ oppy 
disks, or rewritable CDs as well.

Before you create a new ﬁ lesystem, make sure of the following:

 ■ You have partitioned the disk as you want (using the fdisk command).

 ■ You get the device name correct, or you may end up overwriting your hard disk by 
mistake.
