If the addresses are wrong, you can 
override them.

With NetworkManager enabled, you can’t just add name server entries to the /etc/
resolv.conf ﬁ le because NetworkManager overwrites that ﬁ le with its own name 
server entries. Instead, add a PEERDNS=no line to the ifcfg ﬁ le for the network 
interface (for example, ifcfg-eth0 in the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts 
directory).
