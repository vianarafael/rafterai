Some 
applications use recipients such as the postmaster address (for example, errors from Mtas are usually 
sent to the user postmaster at your domain) and the root user. Since people do not generally log in as 
either of these users, this e-mail might never get seen. postfix uses a function called aliases to allow 
you to redirect mail sent to these recipients to other users.
