Similar to a switch statement 
in programming languages, this can take the place of several nested if statements. The 
 following is the general form of the case statement:

case "VAR" in
   Result1)
      { body };;
   Result2)
      { body };;
   *)
      { body };;
esac

Among other things, you can use the case command to help with your backups.
