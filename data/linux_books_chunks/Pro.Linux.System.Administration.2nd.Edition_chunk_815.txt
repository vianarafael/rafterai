On most distributions these checks are generally as follows:

•	 Minimum password length of four characters

•	 Not a palindrome (i.e., the reverse of the last password)

•	 Not the same as the previous password with a case change (i.e., password to 

PASSWORD)

Some basic similarity checking

Some simplicity tests based on the length of the password and the combination of 
characters (all alpha, all numeric, etc.)

Simple rotation checks (i.e., rotating letters in a password, such as ginger being 
changed to ingerg)

If you provide a password that isn’t sufficiently complex, you’ll be given an error message indicating 

what is wrong with your password.
