You donâ€™t 
see ext3 much on newer systems, but you do see ext2 as the filesystem for the /boot partition on Ubuntu 
16.04 by default.

One of the major differences between ext2 and ext3 was journaling support. With ext2, if there was a 

crash, you can expect very long fsck waits before you could mount the disk again. To combat this issue, the 
journaled filesystem was created.
