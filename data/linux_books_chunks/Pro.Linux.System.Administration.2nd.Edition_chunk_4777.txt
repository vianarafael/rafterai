We need to make sure 
that we have /etc/ssl/certs/cacert.pem installed in the correct location; otherwise, we will be rejected 
from the LDAP server.

Once we have placed cacert.pem in the correct place, we can test to see whether we can query the 

LDAP server for users.

$ grep ataylor /etc/passwd

On our host, this returns no result, meaning that the user ataylor has not been created, but we did 
create her in our LDAP configuration.
