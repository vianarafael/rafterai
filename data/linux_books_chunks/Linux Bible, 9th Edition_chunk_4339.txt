If you get an error while using the ecryptfs utilities, make sure you did not use the syntax 
encryptfs by mistake.

In the example that follows, the user johndoe will have a subdirectory encrypted using 
the ecryptfs utility. First, there should be no Ô¨Å les currently residing in the directory 
before it is encrypted.
