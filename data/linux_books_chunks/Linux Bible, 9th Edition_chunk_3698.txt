For example, if you know that the /usr/local/share directory is being shared from the 
computer on your network named shuttle, you can do the following:

$ cd /net/shuttle/

If that computer has any shared directories that are available to you, you can successfully 
change to that directory.

You also can type the following:

$ ls
usr

You should be able to see that the usr directory is part of the path to a shared directory.
