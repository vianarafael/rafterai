The syntax for 
using -exec and -ok is the same:

$ find [options] -exec command {} \;
$ find [options] -ok command {} \;

With -exec or -ok, you run find with any options you like to ﬁ nd the ﬁ les you are 
 looking for. Then enter the -exec or -ok option, followed by the command you want 
to run on each ﬁ le.
