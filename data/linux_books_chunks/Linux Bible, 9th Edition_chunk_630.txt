(Changing your PATH and 
adding directories to it are described later in this chapter.)

Not all the commands you run are located in directories in your PATH variable. Some com-
mands are built into the shell. Other commands can be overridden by creating aliases that 
deÔ¨Å ne any commands and options that you want the command to run.
