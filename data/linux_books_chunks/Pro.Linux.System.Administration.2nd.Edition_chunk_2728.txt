We can quickly double-check that 
these new DNS entries work by performing a lookup via the host command.

$ host 192.168.0.200
200.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer au-mel-centos-2.example.com.
$ host au-mel-centos-2.example.com.
au-mel-centos-2.example.com has address 192.168.0.200

Both lookups work, so we can now configure any other hosts on the network that we also want to have 

dynamically updated in the DNS server.

Manually Changing DNS Entries
Because these dynamic updates use a journal file, you need to perform an extra step if you want to manually 
change any DNS entries.
