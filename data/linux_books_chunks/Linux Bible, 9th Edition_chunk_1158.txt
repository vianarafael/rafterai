So, if you want to have the shell interpret a single 
character literally, precede it with a backslash (\). To have a whole set of characters interpreted  literally, 
surround those characters with single quotes (').

Using double quotes is a bit trickier. Surround a set of text with double quotes if you want all but a 
few characters used literally.
