It does not take long on this system until the array is up.

$ cat /proc/mdstat
Personalities : [raid1] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4]
md0 : active raid5 sde[4] sdf[3](S) sdd[1] sdc[0]
      16765952 blocks super 1.2 level 5, 512k chunk, algorithm 2 [3/3] [UUU]

You now have a RAID 5 array with three active devices and one spare.
