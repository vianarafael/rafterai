Letâ€™s start Gluster on our Ubuntu server; to do that, we execute the following:

$ sudo systemctl start glusterfs-server

If we had chosen our CentOS server, we would issue the following:

$ sudo systemctl start glusterd && sudo systemctl start glusterfsd

Of course, we can check that the services started properly by issuing sudo systemctl status 

<service.name>, but we are going to run one of the gluster commands.
