As cloud environments become more popular, look for monitoring tools that go with 
OpenStack, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, and other cloud platforms to improve 
centralized monitoring of hypervisors, virtual machines, containers, and the 
underlying storage, networking, and authentications services that support them.

Although in-depth coverage of enterprise deployment and monitoring tools is outside the 
scope of this book, refer to Chapter 26, “Using Linux for Cloud Computing,” for further 
information on how different Linux-based cloud platforms manage these issues.

Summary
Although many different types of servers are available with Linux systems, the basic 
 procedure for installing and conﬁ guring a server is essentially the same.
