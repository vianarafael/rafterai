For example, if you typed echo $HOME, the shell would think you meant to display the name of 
your home directory (stored in the $HOME variable) to the screen (such as /home/chris) because a $ 
indicates a variable name follows that character.

If you wanted to literally show $HOME, you would need to escape the $. Typing echo '$HOME' or echo 
\$HOME would literally show $HOME on the screen.
