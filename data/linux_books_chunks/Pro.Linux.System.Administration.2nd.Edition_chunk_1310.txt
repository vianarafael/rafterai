Let’s add that to device enp0s8.

$ sudo ip addr add 192.168.10.1/24 dev enp0s8

Looking at the result of $ sudo ip addr show enp0s8 we see that we have the following line added to 

our output:

    inet 192.168.10.1/24 scope global enp0s8

225

CHAPter 7 ■ NetworkiNg AND FirewAllS

This what we expect, but the status is still down, so we would now issue the following command:

$ sudo ip link set dev enp0s8 up

And on viewing the output of ip addr show enp0s8 again, it will now be in the UP state and ready to 

send and receive traffic on the at interface.
