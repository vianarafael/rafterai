This command is part of the suite of 
commands used to interact with the LDAP server (or any LDAP server). In this example, we have passed in 
the â€“Q argument to ldapsearch to enable SASL quiet mode (as we are using elevated sudo privileges). The 
three Ls (-LLL) all have a meaning. Having one means print in the LDIF format; the other two reduce the 
output.
