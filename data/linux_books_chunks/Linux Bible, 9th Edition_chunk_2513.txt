Here are a few things you 
should know about adding address aliases:

 ■ A Netmask is required for each address, but a gateway is not required.

 ■ The Apply button stays grayed out until you include valid information in the ﬁ elds.

 ■ The new address does not have to be on the same subnetwork as the original 
address, although it is listening for trafﬁ c on the same physical network.

Chapter 14: Administering Networking

After adding the address 192.168.99.1 to my wired interface, running ip addr show 
p4p1 displays the following indication of the two IP addresses on the interface:

2: p4p1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 
      qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:1b:21:0a:e8:5e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.0.187/24 brd 192.168.0.255 scope global p4p1
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet 192.168.99.1/24 brd 192.168.99.255 scope global p4p1
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

For information on setting up aliases directly in conﬁ guration ﬁ les, refer to the section 
“Setting alias network interfaces” later in this chapter.

Setting routes
When you request a connection to an IP address, your system looks through your routing 
table to determine the path on which to connect to that address.
