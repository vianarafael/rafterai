This option takes the same parameters as the -L option, 
but instead specifies an optional remote address and mandatory port number to listen on the remote host, 
followed by a local address and port number for the tunnel end point.

To allow a remote user to connect to a normally inaccessible SSH server on our local network, we can 

create a remote tunnel on port 2022 that forwards connections to port 22 on a host on our local network.

$ ssh -R 192.168.1.1:2022:192.168.0.15:22 ataylor@192.168.1.1

After weâ€™re logged on to the host 192.168.1.1 as user ataylor, we can SSH to port 2022 on the local host, 

which will then log us in to SSH on the host at 192.168.0.15.

For security reasons, the start of the tunnel will only ever bind to the loopback network interface, so 

users on different hosts on the network are not able to use the tunnel.
