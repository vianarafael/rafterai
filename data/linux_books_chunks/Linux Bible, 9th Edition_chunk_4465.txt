Instead, the new password is provided by the previously stacked password 
module.

 ■ dictpath=/path

Path to the cracklib dictionaries.

For example, if your organization requires passwords to be ten characters long and they 
must contain two digits, you would add a line similar to the following to the /etc/pam.d/
system-auth ﬁ le:

password required pam_cracklib.so minlen=10 dcredit=-2

The keywords used in this example with pam_cracklib are:

 ■ minlen=10—The new password must be at least ten characters.

 ■ dcredit=-2—The new password must contain two numbers.
