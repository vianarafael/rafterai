This outputs a certificate signed by our CA. We now have our public certificate 
file, gateway.example.com.cert. We need to copy this file to the /etc/pki/tls/certs directory on our 
gateway host. We will also need to copy the CA root certificate.

To do this, we have an OpenSSH shell open on both the CA server and the gateway server.
