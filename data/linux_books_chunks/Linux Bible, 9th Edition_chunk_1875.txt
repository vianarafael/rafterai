Replace expire_date with a date you want to use. (For example, to expire an 
account on May 5, 2017, use -e 2017-05-05.)

 ■ -f -1—Set the number of days after a password expires until the account is per-
manently disabled. The default, -1, disables the option. Setting this to 0 disables 
the account immediately after the password has expired.
