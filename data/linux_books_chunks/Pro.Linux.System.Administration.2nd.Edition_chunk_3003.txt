The latest version at the 

time of this writing is WordPress 4.5.3. Weâ€™ll download it to our home directory using the curl command.

$ curl https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz -o wordpress.tar.gz

Next, we unpack the tarball. We can unpack it here and then move the required files and directories to 

the web root, or we can unpack it directly to the web root.
