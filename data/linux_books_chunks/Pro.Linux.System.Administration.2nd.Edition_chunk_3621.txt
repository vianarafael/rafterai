We discussed IMAP and POP3, protocols that allow your users to connect to 
your host and retrieve and manage their e-mail in mailboxes.
In the process, we covered some important concepts:

•	

•	

Protecting your users’ e-mail and their authentication credentials via encryption

Enabling SASL authentication to allow your users to safely and securely authenticate 
to your mail server to send and receive e-mail

•	 Making use of SpamAssassin to filter your e-mail and stop spam from reaching your 

users

•	 Using the open source ClamAV antivirus engine to check your user’s e-mail for 

viruses and malware

•	 Using LMTPs such as Dovecot and Sieve to filter your e-mail

•	

•	

Further protecting your server and its reputation by using SPF and DKIM

Implementing the Dovecot server to allow users to connect to their mailboxes and 
retrieve e-mail

In the next chapter, we’ll introduce you to file and print services and teach you how to run your own 

NFS server and look at clustered network file systems.
