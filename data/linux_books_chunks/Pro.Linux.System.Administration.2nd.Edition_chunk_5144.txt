We could rotate this file daily and 
keep the rotated files for seven days. The log rotation process would kick off at a time we specified, copy the 
existing mail.log file to mail.log.1, for example, and then create an empty mail.log file. The log rotation 
process would also increment; if a mail.log.1 file existed, this file would be renamed to mail.log.2, and so 
on.
