For example, if we were to 
monitor that a host is active using an ICMP ping (which we discussed in Chapter 7), we could configure it to 
alert if it canâ€™t contact the host or if responses take longer than a specified time to return.

To do this monitoring, you tell Nagios about your hosts and services by defining them as objects in the 
Nagios configuration.
