If 
you wanted to restrict access to certain profiles, you would edit this file by listing the resources the 
profile has access to (see http://doc.bareos.org/master/html/bareos-manual-main-reference.
html#x1-1510009.12 for more details).

We now need the Bareos Director to read these files in when it starts.
