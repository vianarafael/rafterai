With Netfilter we can record in our logs connection attempts as they come 
into our firewall, then either accept or reject those connections. This in itself can be an attack vector as an 
attacker can fill your firewall logs with connection attempts and either use that to mask another attack or 
make the constant logging of bad connection swamp your firewall resources.
