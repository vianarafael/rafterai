You can also add your own scripts in these directories to run 
them every hour, day, week, or month.

$ ls -l /etc/cron.daily/
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  379 Dec 19  2016 0anacron
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  118 Oct  1 00:06 cups
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  180 Oct 22  2017 logrotate
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  114 Jan 16  2018 rpm
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  290 Nov 26  2016 tmpwatch

Let’s view one of these files, /etc/cron.daily/rpm, and see what is inside it.

$ less /etc/cron.daily/rpm
#!/bin/sh

/bin/rpm -qa --qf '%{name}-%{version}-%{release}.%{arch}.rpm\n' 2>&1 \
           | /bin/sort > /var/log/rpmpkgs

214

This daily executed script populates the /var/log/rpmpkgs file with a sorted list of all the RPM packages 

on your host.

 We’ll discuss rpM packages further in Chapter 8.

Individual users can also create a crontab.
