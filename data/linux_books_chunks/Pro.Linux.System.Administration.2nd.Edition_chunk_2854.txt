The Hypertext Markup Language 

(HTML)–like syntax <IfModule ssl_module>…</IfModule> denotes that the Listen 443 directive should 
be loaded only if the ssl_module is loaded. This can prevent Apache from erroring when modules have not 
been enabled yet.

Ubuntu also differs from CentOS in the way that you include modules and configuration files, like 
virtual hosts.
