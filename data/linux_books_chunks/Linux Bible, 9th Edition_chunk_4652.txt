The example here shows these commands being used:

# getsebool -a | grep http
...
httpd_can_network_connect --> off
...

The getsebool command shows the Boolean httpd_can_network_connect is set to off. 
To change this Boolean, use the following command: setsebool -P httpd_can_network_
connect on. Notice the -P option was used to make the setting permanent.
