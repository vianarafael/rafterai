The plugin configuration option allows us to specify external plug-ins, in our case a PAM 
plug-in called openvpn-pluging-auth-pam.so that ships with the OpenVPN package.

On Ubuntu, the plug-in is located at /usr/lib/openvpn/openvpn-plugin-auth-pam.so.
We also need to specify the name of a PAM authentication file that OpenVPN will use to authenticate 

the VPN tunnel.
