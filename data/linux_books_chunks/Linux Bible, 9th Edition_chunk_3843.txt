Someone debugging a desktop may boot to runlevel 5 and 
then go down to runlevel 3 to try to Ô¨Å x the desktop (such as install a new driver or change 
screen resolution) before typing init 5 to return to the desktop.

The level of services at each runlevel is determined by the runlevel scripts that are 
set to start.
