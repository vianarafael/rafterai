#!/bin/bash
# (@)/ph
# A very simple telephone list
# Type "ph new name number" to add to the list, or
# just type "ph name" to get a phone number

PHONELIST=~/.phonelist.txt

# If no command line parameters ($#), there
# is a problem, so ask what they're talking about.
if [ $# -lt 1 ] ; then
  echo "Whose phone number did you want? "
   exit 1
fi

# Did you want to add a new phone number?
if [ $1 = "new" ] ; then
  shift
  echo $* >> $PHONELIST
  echo $* added to database
  exit 0
fi

# Nope.
