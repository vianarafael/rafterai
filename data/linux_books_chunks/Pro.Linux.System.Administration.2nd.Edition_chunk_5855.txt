Letâ€™s run the 

Serverspec test again.

$ rake spec
Package "apache2"
  should be installed

Service "apache2"
  should be enabled
  should be running

Port "80"
  should be listening

Finished in 0.06987 seconds (files took 11.03 seconds to load)
4 examples, 0 failures
...
Package "httpd"
  should be installed

Service "httpd"
  should be enabled (FAILED - 1)
  should be running (FAILED - 2)

Port "80"
  should be listening (FAILED - 3)

Running rake spec will run the tests over any of the hosts in our spec/ folder.
