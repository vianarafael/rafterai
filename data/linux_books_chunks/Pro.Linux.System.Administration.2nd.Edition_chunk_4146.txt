You can also choose your GZIP compression ratio with choosing between GZIP1 to GZIP9 (with GZIP9 
being the best, and slowest, compression).

With the signature, you can use either SHA1 or MD5, but MD5 will add an extra overhead to each file 
saved in both data size and CPU time. The signature is stored in the catalog for use with verification of the 
fileâ€™s contents and if they have changed.
