In this LogFormat directive we are getting Apache to include the virtual host (%v) and 
port (%p) of the virtual host accepting the request. Next we have the remote hostname (%h) and remote 
username (%l), the authenticated user (%u). The request is recorded (%r) along with the final status (%>s) and 
byte size (%O).
