We also sent a Host header (-H 'Host:) with the 
name of the web server we wanted to send our request to. Apache will read this header and pass this request 
to the corresponding virtual host. If it cannot find a virtual host with the same ServerName field, it will route 
the request to the “base” virtual host or, in other words, the first it loaded.
