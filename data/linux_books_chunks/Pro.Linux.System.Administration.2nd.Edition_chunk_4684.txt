-v is to be verbose in its information. When you specify -D, 
you give the username you want to bind with. In this case, we are using the cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com 
user, and as you may remember, this is the rootDN we added to the SLAPD server earlier. The -h switch 
is the hostname, ldap.example.com.
