You can have it listen on multiple addresses by adding additional ListenAddress directives.

For instance, to make the SSH server on our bastion host listen on ports 22 and 2022 only on the 

internal network interfaces, we can add these directives to the configuration file:

Chapter 10 â–  InfrastruCture servICes: ntp, Dns, DhCp, anD ssh 

Port 22
Port 2022
ListenAddress 192.168.0.1
ListenAddress 19.168.1.1

We can now tell the server to reload its configuration file via sudo systemctl reload sshd on CentOS 

or sudo systemctl reload ssh on Ubuntu.
