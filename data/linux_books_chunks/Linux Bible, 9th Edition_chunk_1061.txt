The following list includes actions you can do with top to display information in different 
ways and modify running processes:

 ■ Press h to see help options, and then press any key to return to the top display.

 ■ Press M to sort by memory usage instead of CPU, and then press P to return to 

 sorting by CPU.

 ■ Press the number 1 to toggle showing CPU usage of all your CPUs, if you have more 

than one CPU on your system.

 ■ Press R to reverse sort your output.

 ■ Press u and enter a username to display processes only for a particular user.

A common practice is to use top to ﬁ nd processes that are consuming too much 
 memory or processing power and then act on those processes in some way.
