Entering a strong passphrase

Enter a strong passphrase and securely store that in an encrypted password manager.

 â–  Tip  You can use a reputable browser-based encrypted password manager like 1password, Lastpass, or 
DashLane. Some of these have group or team support to allow you to share passwords among team members 
in an authorized way. Believe me, this is actually a hard problem.
