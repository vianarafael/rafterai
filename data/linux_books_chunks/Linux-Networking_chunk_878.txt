For this we use the force user and force group options.
Now  we  can  be  sure  that  all  files  in  the  Samba  writable  share  are  owned  by  the  same
sambanobody user.

Below is the renewed definition of our share in smb.conf.

[pubwrite]
 path = /srv/samba/writable
 comment = files to write
 force user = sambanobody
 force group = sambanobody
 read only = no
 guest ok = yes

When you reconnect to the share and write a file, then this sambanobody user will own the
newly created file (and nobody needs to know the password).
