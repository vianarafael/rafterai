The latter will allow us to also 
install and use PHP-based webmail applications.

On CentOS, we can install all this via sudo yum install php-fpm php-mysql php-gd php-imap php-
mbstring and on Ubuntu via sudo aptitude install php-fpm php-mysql php-mbstring php-gd php-imap.

We are going to set up a web site that uses PHP later in this chapter.
