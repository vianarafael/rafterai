Multiple Priorities

auth;auth-priv.debug;auth-priv.!=emerg        /var/log/auth

This example shows you how to send all auth messages and all auth-priv messages with a priority of 

debug or higher, excluding auth-priv messages of emerg priority to the file /var/log/auth.

 â–  Tip 
 Just remember with multiple selectors that filtering works from left to right; rsyslogd will process the 
line starting from the selectors on the left and moving to the right of each succeeding selector.
