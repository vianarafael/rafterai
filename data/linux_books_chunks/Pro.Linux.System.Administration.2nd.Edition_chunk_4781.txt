Now any LDAP user can sign into our hosts and have their home 
directories created.

We can further refine our sssd.conf file to filter for certain users, like only if they have exampleActive 

set to TRUE.

ldap_access_filter = (exampleActive=TRUE)

If you are using the Ubuntu Unity desktop, you will need to make a change to the following file to allow 

other users to log in from the desktop:

/usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-unity-greeter.conf
[Seat:*]
greeter-session=unity-greeter
greeter-show-manual-login=true

This will allow you to see a screen like in FigureÂ 16-11 after a reboot of your Ubuntu desktop.
