user owner and group owner

The users and groups of a system can be locally managed in /etc/passwd and /etc/group,
or they can be in a NIS, LDAP, or Samba domain. These users and groups can own files.
Actually, every file has a user owner and a group owner, as can be seen in the following
screenshot.
