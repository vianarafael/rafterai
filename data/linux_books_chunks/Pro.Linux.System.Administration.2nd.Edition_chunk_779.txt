On Ubuntu, the first new user would have a 
UID and GID of 1000 as well.

 You can control the range of the UIds and GIds that are provided to users in the /etc/login.defs file. 

 ■ Tip 
edit the UID_MIN and UID_MAX range for UIds and the GID_MIN and GID_MAX range for GIds. It’s unlikely you’ll 
ever want to do this, but the option is there.
