Rather than use a trademark symbol with 
every occurrence of a trademarked name, logo, or image we use the names, logos, and images only in an 
editorial fashion and to the benefit of the trademark owner, with no intention of infringement of the trademark.

The use in this publication of trade names, trademarks, service marks, and similar terms, even if they are 
not identified as such, is not to be taken as an expression of opinion as to whether or not they are subject to 
proprietary rights.

While the advice and information in this book are believed to be true and accurate at the date of publication, 
neither the authors nor the editors nor the publisher can accept any legal responsibility for any errors or 
omissions that may be made.
