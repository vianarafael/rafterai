If you delete a user, then all the user’s objects will 
no longer be owned by the user. You can identify these objects because the username will be replaced in the 
file listing with the former UID (the same applies for any deleted groups). As a result, if you create another 
user that uses the same UID or GID, that user will now own the deleted user’s files.
