On the Puppet master, we 
need to add our profile module and add some configuration to apply to our client.

A module should have the following structure:

modulename/
                    |- manifests
                                      |- init.pp
                    |- files
                    |- templates

At the least, you need the manifests directory; you may see other modules with more directories, like 

spec and lib as wellâ€”for testing and module code, respectively.

We have created the profile module directory in /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/

sites already.
