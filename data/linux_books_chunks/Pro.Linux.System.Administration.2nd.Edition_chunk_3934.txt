We could also 
create a security mechanism called a chroot jail on our remote hosts, but this will limit our ability to access 
the rest of the host’s file systems.

 For information on how to set up chroot jails, visit https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/

We could use passphrases with our keys and use a tool called key-chain to cache our passphrase for 
our connection, but we would have to enter the passphrase each time we rebooted the host, which is not 
ideal.
