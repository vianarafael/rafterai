If you want to test this, you’ll need to specify an actual live host.

 In reality, if you run this exact command, it won’t work, as the host us-ny-server-1.example.

There are also a variety of SSH clients or terminal emulators available, for example, the popular and free 

PuTTY client (available from www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/), which runs on Windows 
(and also on Linux).
