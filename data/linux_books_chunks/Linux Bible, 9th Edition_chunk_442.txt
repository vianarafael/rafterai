This tool is not installed by default with the 
Fedora GNOME Live CD, but you can add it by installing the gnome-tweak-tool package. 
(See Chapter 10, “Getting and Managing Software,” for information on how to install soft-
ware packages in Fedora.)

After installation, the GNOME Tweak Tool is available by launching the Advanced Settings 
icon from your Applications screen.
