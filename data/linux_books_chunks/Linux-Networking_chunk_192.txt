/etc/sysconfig/network

The /etc/sysconfig/network file is a global (across all network cards) configuration file.
It  allows  us  to  define  whether  we  want  networking  (NETWORKING=yes|no),  what  the
hostname should be (HOSTNAME=) and which gateway to use (GATEWAY=).

[root@rhel6 ~]# cat /etc/sysconfig/network
NETWORKING=yes
HOSTNAME=rhel6
GATEWAY=192.168.1.1

There are a dozen more options settable in this file, details can be found in /usr/share/doc/
initscripts-*/sysconfig.txt.

Note that this file contains no settings at all in a default RHEL7 install (with networking
enabled).
