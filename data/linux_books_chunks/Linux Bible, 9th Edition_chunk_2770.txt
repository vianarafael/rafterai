The following example 
shows two service statusesâ€”one that has been ported to Upstart and one that has not.

# initctl status vpnc-cleanup
vpnc-cleanup stop/waiting
# service ssh status
sshd (pid  970) is running...

In this example, the ssh daemon had not yet been ported to Upstart. Therefore, ssh needs 
the service command with the status option to be used to check its status.
