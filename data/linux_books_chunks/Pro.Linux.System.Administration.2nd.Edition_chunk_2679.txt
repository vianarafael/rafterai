The default-lease-time directive specifies how long a DHCP 
lease will be active if a connecting client does not specify a time. If it does specify a time, this time cannot 
be longer than max-lease-time. Both settings specify a time in seconds. Finally, the log-facility specifies 
how the system logger should handle log entries generated by the DHCP server.
