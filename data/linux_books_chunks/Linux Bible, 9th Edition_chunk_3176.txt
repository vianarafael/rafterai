For web connections, the SSL connection is established ﬁ rst, 
and then normal HTTP communication is “tunneled” through it.

Because SSL negotiation takes place before any HTTP communication, name-based virtual hosting (which occurs at 
the HTTP layer) does not work easily with SSL. As a consequence, every SSL virtual host you confi gure should have 
a unique IP address.
