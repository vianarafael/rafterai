You can see that this has produced a list of the kernels installed.

 â–  Note  You see more than one kernel in Listing 8-7 because you can have more than one kernel installed. 
this does not mean you have multiple kernels running at the same time; rather, you have multiple potential 
kernels you could run.

Those numbers at the end of each kernel installed are different versions.
