For CentOS hosts, the configuration directory is called /etc/openldap instead of /etc/
ldap that you will find on Ubuntu hosts. Both distributions store the databases in /var/lib/ldap.

For example, the configuration files for OpenLDAP on a CentOS host are stored in /etc/openldap/.

$ sudo ls -l /etc/openldap/
total 12
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root   85 Oct 26 12:46 certs
