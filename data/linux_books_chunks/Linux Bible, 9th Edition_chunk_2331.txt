Instead of a ﬁ le, pass a directory 
name to the scp command and all ﬁ les and directories below that point in the ﬁ lesystem 
are copied to the other system.

$ scp johndoe@10.140.67.23:/usr/share/man/man1/ /tmp/
johndoe@10.140.67.23's password: ***************
volname.1.gz                              100%  543   0.5KB/s  00:00
mtools.1.gz                               100% 6788   6.6KB/s  00:00
roqet.1.gz                                100% 2496   2.4KB/s  00:00
...

As long as the user johndoe has access to the ﬁ les and directories on the remote system 
and the local user can write to the target directory (both are true in this case), the  directory 
structure from /usr/share/man/man1 down is copied to the local /tmp directory.

The scp command can be used to back up ﬁ les and directories over a network.
