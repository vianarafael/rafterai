When we explained chains, we said they were 
like hooks. The parameters are the different types of bait that sit on the hook. Each parameter will attract 
packets depending on the information in the packet. It can be the source and destination addresses of the 
packet or the protocol. The packet can furthermore be matched to source or destination ports or the state 
the packet is in.
