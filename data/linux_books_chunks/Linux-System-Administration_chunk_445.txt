raid 1

raid  1  uses  exactly  two  disks,  and  is  often  called  mirroring  (or  mirror  set,  or  mirrored
volume). All data written to the array is written on each disk. The main advantage of raid 1
is redundancy. The main disadvantage is that you lose at least half of your available disk
space (in other words, you at least double the cost).
