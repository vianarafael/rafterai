When an access request comes into your LDAP host, the access 

control list is parsed, and if a match is found, access is either granted or denied. You can speed your access 
requests by putting your access control list in order of most requested access to least. You want all those 
common requests to be toward the top of your access control list and the less common requests closer to the 
bottom.
