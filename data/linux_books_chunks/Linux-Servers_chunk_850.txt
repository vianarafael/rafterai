git

Linus Torvalds created git back in 2005 when Bitkeeper changed its license and the Linux
kernel developers where no longer able to use it for free.

git quickly became popular and is now the most widely used distributed version control
system in the world.

Geek and Poke demonstrates why we need version control (image property of Geek and

Besides source code for software, you can also find German and Icelandic law on github
(and probably much more by the time you are reading this).
