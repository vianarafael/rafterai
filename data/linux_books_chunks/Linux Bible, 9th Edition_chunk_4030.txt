For example, if someone had deleted /bin/mount by 
 mistake, the system would have no command to mount ﬁ lesystems. Reinstalling 
the  util-linux package would replace the missing mount command.

 ■ Check the ﬁ lesystems. If your booting problems stem from corrupt ﬁ lesystems, 
you can try running the fsck command (ﬁ lesystem check) to see if there is any 
corruption on the disk partition.
