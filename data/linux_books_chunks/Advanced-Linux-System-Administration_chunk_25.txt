Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve 
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. 

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many 
as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
