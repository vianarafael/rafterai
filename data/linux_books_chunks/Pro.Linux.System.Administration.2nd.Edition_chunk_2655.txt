Adding Zone Definitions

acl "transfer-hosts" {
        192.168.0.254 ;
        127.0.0.1 ;
};
zone "example.com" {
    type master;
    file "master/example.com.db";
    notify yes;

    allow-transfer {
      transfer-hosts ;
    };
    key-directory "/etc/bind/keys";
    auto-dnssec maintain;
    inline-signing yes;
};

What we have done in Figure 10-26 is use a variable called “transfer-hosts,” which we created with 

the acl option in our bind zone configuration file.
