The output 
this command generates is then interpreted by eval.

$ ssh-agent -k
unset SSH_AUTH_SOCK;
unset SSH_AGENT_PID;
echo Agent pid 11535 killed;
$ eval `ssh-agent`
Agent pid 11541

All we need to do now is unlock the private key and add it to the agent.

$ ssh-add
Enter passphrase for /home/jsmith/.ssh/id_rsa:
Identity added: /home/jsmith/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/jsmith/.ssh/id_rsa)

We are able to connect to any host that contains the matching public key, without any further need to 

enter a password.

$ ssh jsmith@au-mel-centos-1
Last login: Tue Feb 10 15:17:19 2009 from au-mel-ubuntu-1.example.com
[jsmith@au-mel-centos-1 ~]$

 â–  Tip  You can tell multiple shells on the same host that you are using the agent by simply setting the SSH_
AUTH_SOCK and SSH_AGENT_PID variables to the correct values in the shell.

Tweaking SSH Configuration
When all your SSH servers listen on the same port and you use a single key pair for all hosts, the default 
server configuration will suit you fine.
