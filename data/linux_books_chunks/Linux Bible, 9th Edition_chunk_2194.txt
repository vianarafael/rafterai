This 
is useful for downloaded CD images from which you want to install software without 
having to burn the image to CD. You could also share that mount point over NFS, so 
you could install the software from another computer. When you are ﬁ nished, just type 
umount/mnt/mycdimage to unmount it.

Other options to mount are available only for speciﬁ c ﬁ lesystem types.
