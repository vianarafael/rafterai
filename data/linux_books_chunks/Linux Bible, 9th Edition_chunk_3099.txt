You don’t have to use SELinux. You can set SELinux to 

Permissive mode if you feel it is too difﬁ cult and unnecessary to create the SELinux 
policies needed to get your web server to work with SELinux in Enforcing mode. 
You can change the mode to Permissive by editing the /etc/sysconfig/selinux 
ﬁ le so the SELINUX value is set as follows.
