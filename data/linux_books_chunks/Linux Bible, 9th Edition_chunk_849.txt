So, if I wanted to go 
to the directory /home/joe/test, I could type cd ~joe/test to get there.

Other special ways of identifying directories in the shell include the following:

 ■ .—A single dot (.) refers to the current directory.

 ■ ..—Two dots (..) refer to a directory directly above the current directory.

 ■ $PWD—This environment variable refers to the current working directory.

 ■ $OLDPWD—This environment variable refers to the previous working directory before 
you changed to the current one.
