This means the snapshot volume
has to keep more original data (10.22 percent).

[root@RHEL5 ~]# lvs | grep vg42
  bigLV    vg42       owi-ao 200.00M                              
  snapLV   vg42       swi-a- 100.00M bigLV   10.22                
[root@RHEL5 ~]#

You can now use regular backup tools (dump, tar, cpio, ...) to take a backup of the snapshot
Logical Volume.
