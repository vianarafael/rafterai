To prepare your system to run a vsftpd FTP server that is protected by SELinux, 

log in as a regular (we use chris in this example) and try to copy a ﬁ le (which 
should cause an AVC denial), type the following:

# getenforce
Enforcing
# yum install vsftpd lftp rsyslog setroubleshoot-server
# systemctl start syslog
# systemctl start vsftpd
# semodule -DB
# getsebool ftp_home_dir
ftp_home_dir --> off
# lftp -u chris localhost
Password: ********
lftp chris@localhost:~> put /etc/services
put: Access failed: 553 Could not create file.
