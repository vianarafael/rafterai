Now we create the policy package with the 
following command:

semodule_package â€“o clamav-write.pp -m clamav-write.mod

We have created the policy package by passing the module (-m) file to the semodule_package command 

and have written it (-o) to the clamav-write.pp file. Now we are ready to load this policy package into 
SELinux.
