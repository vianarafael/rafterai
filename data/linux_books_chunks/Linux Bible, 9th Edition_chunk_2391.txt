That way, if you ever need to 
switch the loghost duties to a different machine, you need to change only the loghost alias; 
you do not need to re-edit the syslog.conf ﬁ le on every computer.

The loghost that is set to accept the messages must listen for those messages on standard 
ports (514 UDP, although it can be conﬁ gured to accept messages on 514 TCP as well).
