Letâ€™s demonstrate how to 

change that to our local time zone.

First we are going to list the time zones, but because the result is a very long list we are going to use grep 

to return only the result for Melbourne.

$ timedatectl list-timezones |grep Melb
Australia/Melbourne

Now to set the time zone we issue the following:

$ sudo timedatectl set-timezone Australia/Melbourne

Now when we check our status we have the correct time zone set.

$ timedatectl status
      Local time: Sat 2016-10-01 11:29:01 AEST
  Universal time: Sat 2016-10-01 01:29:01 UTC
        RTC time: Fri 2016-09-30 18:13:03
       Time zone: Australia/Melbourne (AEST, +1000)
     NTP enabled: yes

You can use the timedatectl --help option to list more options.
