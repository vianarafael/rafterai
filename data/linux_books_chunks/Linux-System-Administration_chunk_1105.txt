If you create the .ssh directory manually, then you need
to chmod 700 it! Otherwise ssh will refuse to use the keys (world readable private keys are
not secure!).

As you can see, the .ssh directory is secure in Alice's home directory.

[alice@RHEL5 ~]$ ls -ld .ssh
drwx------ 2 alice alice 4096 May  1 07:38 .ssh
[alice@RHEL5 ~]$
