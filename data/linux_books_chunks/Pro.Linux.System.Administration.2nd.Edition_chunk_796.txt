But if you do decide to delete 
a user, you can run the command find / -user UID –o –group GID to find all the files associated with the 
user you have just deleted.

To delete a group, use the groupdel command and specify the name of the group to be deleted.

$ sudo groupdel finance

This command will remove the group from the host.
