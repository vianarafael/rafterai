hierarchy

The dns namespace is hierarchical tree structure, with the root servers (aka dot-servers) at
the top. The root servers are usually represented by a dot.

Below the root-servers are the Top Level Domains or tld's.

There are more tld's than shown in the picture. Currently about 200 countries have a tld.
