Schedule scripts that parse log files and email them

We can use a perl script to run last in order to read /var/run/utmp and get it to search for the 
string still which will match all logged users and mail the line to root.

#!/usr/bin/perl

$LOGFILE="/tmp/lastlog";
$line="0";
system("last> $LOGFILE");

open (MAIL, "| mail root");

if (open (FILE,"$LOGFILE")) {

        while ($line ne "") { 
             $line=<FILE>;
              if ($line =~ still) {
                  print MAIL $line;
              }
        }
}

close MAIL;

If this script needs to run every hour and it is called /usr/bin/last-log.pl, then you can create a 
symbolic link in /etc/cron.hourly pointing to it.
