The term was 
created by putting together “root,” which means that it has to have administrator access, 
and “kit,” which means it is usually several programs that operate in concert.

A rootkit detector that can be used on a Linux system is chkrootkit. To install 
chkrootkit on a Fedora or RHEL system, issue the command yum install chkrootkit.
