At the time, Linus was 
using Minix, but he wanted to go beyond what the Minix standards permitted.

As noted earlier, Linus announced the ﬁ rst public version of the Linux kernel to the comp
.os.minix newsgroup on August 25, 1991, although Torvalds guesses that the ﬁ rst version 
didn’t actually come out until mid-September of that year.

Although Torvalds stated that Linux was written for the 386 processor and probably wasn’t 
portable, others persisted in encouraging (and contributing to) a more portable approach in 
the early versions of Linux.
