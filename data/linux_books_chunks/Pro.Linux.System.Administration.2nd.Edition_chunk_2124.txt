We recommend you don’t go down the road of resizing partitions 
with parted as these can be disastrous operations, but rather use LVM. We will cover LVM in detail later in 
this chapter. For more information about parted, visit www.gnu.org/software/parted/index.shtml.

 ■ Caution  resizing partitions can cause unrecoverable data loss. always back up your data first!
