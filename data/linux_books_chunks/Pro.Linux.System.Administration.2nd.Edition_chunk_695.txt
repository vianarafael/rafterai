For 
instructions, check the alias commandâ€™s man page.

You can also delete directories and their contents recursively with the -r switch as follows:

$ rm -r /home/jsmith/backup

This would delete the /home/jsmith/backup directory and all its contents.
You can also override the -i switch using the -f, or force, switch like so:

$ rm -fr /home/jsmith/backup

This will also delete the backup directory and all its contents, but you will not be prompted to confirm 
the deletions.
