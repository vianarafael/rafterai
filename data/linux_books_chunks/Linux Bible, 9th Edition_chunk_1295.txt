Add the following line to allow joe to have full root privileges on the computer:

joe     ALL=(ALL)     ALL

This line causes joe to provide a password (his own password, not the root pass-
word) in order to use administrative commands. To allow joe to have that privilege 
without using a password, type the following line instead:

joe    ALL=(ALL)     NOPASSWD: ALL
