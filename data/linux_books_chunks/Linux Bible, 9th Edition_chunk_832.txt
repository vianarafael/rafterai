When you type ls, however, many Linux 
systems (including Fedora and RHEL) assign an alias ls to add options. To see if ls is 
aliased, type the following:

$ alias ls
alias ls='ls --color=auto'

The --color=auto option causes different types of Ô¨Å les and directories to be displayed 
in different colors.
