Each of these takes two 
parameters, the forward starting address and port, separated by a colon, and the end point address and port, 
again separated by a colon.

We can add the forwards we used previously to our client configuration file:

Host gateway
    Hostname 192.168.1.1
    Port 22
    User ataylor
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gateway-ataylor
    LocalForward 8080 192.168.1.12:80
    RemoteForward 192.168.1.1:2022 192.168.0.15:22

Finally, the ForwardAgent yes option makes SSH configure the remote shell to use the SSH agent 

on your local host for any authentication.
