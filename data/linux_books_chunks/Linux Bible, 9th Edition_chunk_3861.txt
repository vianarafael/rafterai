Any command you want to run every time your system starts up can be put in 
the rc.local ﬁ le. 

You might use rc.local to send an e-mail message or run a quick iptables ﬁ rewall rule when 
the system starts. In general, it’s better to use an existing startup script or create a new one 
yourself (so you can manage the command or commands as a service).
