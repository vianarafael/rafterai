Looking at permissions on the directory /var/salesdocs (rwxrwxr-x), you see that the 
second set of rwx shows that any member of the group (sales) has permission to read ﬁ les 
in that directory (r is read), create and delete ﬁ les from that directory (w is write), and 
change to that directory (x is execute).
