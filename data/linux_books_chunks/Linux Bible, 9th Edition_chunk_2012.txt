If you know of a user account available from the LDAP server, use the 
following getent command to check that the account is available:

# getent passwd jsmith
jsmith:x:13599:13600:John Smith:/home/jsmith:/bin/bash

If you see the account information, you know your system was able to retrieve it from the 
LDAP server. The next thing to check is that the authentication method is working as well.
