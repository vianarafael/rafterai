Creating a New User

$ sudo useradd –m –c 'John Smith' jsmith

 In Listing 5-1, you can see we’ve prefixed the useradd command with the sudo command to avoid 

 ■ Note 
having to log on as the root user.

The useradd command has a number of options, and we’re using just a couple in Listing 5-1. The first 
argument, -m, tells the host to create a home directory for the user.
