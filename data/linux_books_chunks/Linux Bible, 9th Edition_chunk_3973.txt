For example, if the httpd process were only listening on the local interface (127.0.0.1) for 
HTTP requests (port 80) the entry would look as follows:

tcp    0  0 127.0.0.1:80 :::*         LISTEN      2567/httpd

For httpd, as well as for other network services that listen for requests on network 
 interfaces, you can edit the service’s main conﬁ guration ﬁ le (in this case, /etc/httpd/
conf/httpd.conf) to tell it to listen on port 80 for all addresses (Listen 80) or a 
 speciﬁ c address (Listen 192.168.0.100:80).
