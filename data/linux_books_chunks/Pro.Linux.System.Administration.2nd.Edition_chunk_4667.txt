For the person class, we MUST provide a cn and an sn entry. We MAY 
provide userPassword, telephone, seeAlso, and description.

It is optional to include the posixAccount and exampleClient object classes. The object class 

posixAccount will provide the attributes useful for Unix/Linux hosts such as userPassword, uid, uidNumber, 
gidNumber, and homeDirectory.
