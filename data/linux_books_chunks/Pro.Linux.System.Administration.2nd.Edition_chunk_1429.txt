When it has this information it will initiate a connection to the 
webserver and then transmit the data in the packet on the physical wire and that information will find its 
way to web server.

You will be interested to know that when you initiate a TCP/IP connection (also known as a socket), 

a three-stage process gets that connection into an “established” state, meaning both hosts are aware of 
their socket to each other, agree how they are going to send data, and are ready to send that data.
