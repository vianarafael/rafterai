Introducing grep

$ grep localhost /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1      localhost.localdomain localhost localhost
::1                 localhost6.localdomain6 localhost6

To use grep, you specify the string you’re searching for, in this case localhost (grep is case sensitive, so 

it will only find this lowercase string), and then the name of the file you’re searching in.

 ■ Note 

 You can make grep case insensitive by adding the -i switch to the command.

By default, grep returns those lines in the file that contain the string we’re searching for.
