Some of the most com-
mon commands you will use are shell built-in commands, such as cd (to change 
 directories), echo (to output text to the screen), exit (to exit from a shell), fg 
(to bring a command running in the background to the foreground), history 
(to see a list of commands that were previously run), pwd (to list the present 
working directory), set (to set shell options), and type (to show the location 
of a command).
