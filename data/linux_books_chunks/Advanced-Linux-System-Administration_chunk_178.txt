LVM Configuration

Logical Volume Management (LVM)

The Logical Volume Management framework allows one to group different block devices 
(disks, partitions, RAID arrays...) together as a single larger device, the volume group 
(VG). 

Individual devices used to form a volume group are referred to as physical volumes (PV).
