Here we are 
selecting the devices we want to monitor and naming them via a regular expression. We may have disks that 
are named in the following ways:

/dev/sda2
/dev/hdb4
/dev/xvda3

We need to be able to match on any of these disk naming conventions. First, we look for the x and v 

together (^(xv)?) and match this pattern zero or more times at the start of string (^).
