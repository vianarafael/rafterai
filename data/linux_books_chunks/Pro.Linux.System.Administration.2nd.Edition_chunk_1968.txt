For example, if you want to install the nmap package with apt-get, you use the following:

$ sudo apt-get install nmap

to find out information about a particular package using the apt-cache command, you use it as follows:

$ sudo apt-cache showpkg nmap

to use the apt-file command to find out which package provides a specific file that is not yet installed 
on the system, you can use apt-file to search the package contents files provided by the repositories:

$ apt-file search /usr/sbin/foo

this requires an up-to-date contents listing on your system.
