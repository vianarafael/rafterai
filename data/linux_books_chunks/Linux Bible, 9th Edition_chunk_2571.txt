/etc/resolv.conf file
DNS servers and search domains are set in the /etc/resolv.conf ﬁ le. If NetworkManager 
is enabled and running, you should not edit this ﬁ le directly. Using DNS?= entries from 
ifcfg-* ﬁ les, NetworkManager overwrites the /etc/resolv.conf ﬁ le so you would lose 
any entries you add to that ﬁ le.
