lan-wan-man

The term lan is used for local area networks, as opposed to a wan for wide area networks.
The difference between the two is determined by the distance between the computers, and
not by the number of computers in a network. Some protocols like atm are designed for use
in a wan, others like ethernet are designed for use in a lan.
