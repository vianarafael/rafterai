SELinux is described in Chapter 24.

Installing and configuring network services
For each of the network services in the list that follows, make sure that you can go through 
the steps to install packages required by the service, set up SELinux to allow access to the 
service, set the service to start at boot time, secure the service by host or by user (using 
iptables, TCP wrappers, or features provided by the service itself), and conÔ¨Å gure it for 
basic operation.
