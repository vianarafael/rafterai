Operator

-a file

-b file

-c file

-d file

-e file

-f file

-g file

-h file

-k file

-L file

What Is Being Tested?

Does the fi le exist? (same as -e)

Is the fi le a block special device?

Is the fi le character special (for example, a character device)? Used to iden-
tify serial lines and terminal devices.

Is the fi le a directory?

Does the fi le exist? (same as -a)

Does the fi le exist, and is it a regular fi le (for example, not a directory, 
socket, pipe, link, or device fi le)?

Does the fi le have the set-group-id (SGID) bit set?

Is the fi le a symbolic link? (same as -L)

Does the fi le have the sticky bit set?

Is the fi le a symbolic link?

7

-n string

Is the length of the string greater than 0 bytes?

-O file

-p file

-r file

-s file

-S file

-t fd

-u file

-w file

-x file

-z string

expr1 -a expr2

expr1 -o expr2

Do you own the fi le?

Is the fi le a named pipe?

Is the fi le readable by you?

Does the fi le exist, and is it larger than 0 bytes?

Does the fi le exist, and is it a socket?

Is the fi le descriptor connected to a terminal?

Does the fi le have the set-user-id (SUID) bit set?

Is the fi le writable by you?

Is the fi le executable by you?

Is the length of the string 0 (zero) bytes?

Are both the fi rst expression and the second expression true?

Is either of the two expressions true?

file1 -nt file2 Is the fi rst fi le newer than the second fi le (using the modifi cation timestamp)?
file1 -ot file2 Is the fi rst fi le older than the second fi le (using the modifi cation timestamp)?
file1 -ef file2 Are the two fi les associated by a link (a hard link or a symbolic link)?
var1 = var2

Is the fi rst variable equal to the second variable?

var1 -eq var2

var1 -ge var2

var1 -gt var2

var1 -le var2

var1 -lt var2

var1 != var2

var1 -ne var2

Is the fi rst variable equal to the second variable?

Is the fi rst variable greater than or equal to the second variable?

Is the fi rst variable greater than the second variable?

Is the fi rst variable less than or equal to the second variable?

Is the fi rst variable less than the second variable?

Is the fi rst variable not equal to the second variable?

Is the fi rst variable not equal to the second variable?

There is also a special shorthand method of performing tests that can be useful for 
simple one-command actions.
