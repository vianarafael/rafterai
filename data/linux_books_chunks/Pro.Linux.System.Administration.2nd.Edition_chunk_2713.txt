We start by changing the ddns-update-style variable 
from none to interim. We also want a fairly low TTL on these dynamic DNS entries, so they don’t remain 
active after a host disappears off the network. We’ll specify an hour.

ddns-update-style interim;
ddns-ttl 3600;

Under that, still in the global configuration section, we add the key definition.
