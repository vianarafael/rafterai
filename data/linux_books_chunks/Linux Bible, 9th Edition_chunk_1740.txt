Ô¨Å nds the latest version of that package available from the repository, downloads it to the 
local system, and installs it. Figure 10.2 shows what happens when someone installs a 
 package using the yum command.

The result of a yum install package command is that the package requested is  copied 
from the yum repository to the local system.
