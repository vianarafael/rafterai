The 

following directive does this:

<FilesMatch "^\.ht">
        Require all denied
</FilesMatch>

This is an example of a match directive, where we can match any file starting with .ht (<FilesMatch 

"^\.ht">) and deny all requests to access these files (Require all denied).

 â–  Note 

 .htaccess files are not really recommended as using them incurs a negative performance impact.

The logging directives describe how we will be logging our Apache information.
