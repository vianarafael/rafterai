You can get a 
list of AWS resources by issuing the following:

$ aws help

Now that we have our AWS credentials set up, we are going to test that we can list our S3 bucket.

$ aws s3 ls our-backup/

If there are no errors, that shows we can list our S3 bucket. We can try to copy, or put, a local file up into 

our S3 bucket.
