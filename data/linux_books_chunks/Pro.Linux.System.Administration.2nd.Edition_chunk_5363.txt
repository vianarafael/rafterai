This allows us to reuse a command for multiple services, as you’ll see in a moment.

Let’s take a quick look at the check_local_disk command:

define command{
          command_name    check_local_disk
          command_line       $USER1$/check_disk -w $ARG1$ -c $ARG2$ -p $ARG3$
          }

Like our previous command, with command_line we’ve specified the $USER1$ macro to give us the path 

to the plug-in being executed.
