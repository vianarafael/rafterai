The system-config-network 
 command has been replaced by the nmtui command (or NetworkManager Text User 
Interface) in RHEL 7. It provides a menu-based interface that runs in the shell. As root, 
type nmtui to see a screen similar to what is presented in Figure 14.5.

Use arrow keys and the Tab key to move around the interface.
