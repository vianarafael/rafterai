In this section, we are 
going to do the following:

•	 Create a new backup volume in GlusterFS and update our GlusterFS configuration

•	

Add a new record to our DNS server

•	 Mount volume and setup directories

•	 Configure Bareos storage

Bareos can talk directly to the Gluster daemon via the libgfapi provided by the bareos-storage-
glusterfs package.
