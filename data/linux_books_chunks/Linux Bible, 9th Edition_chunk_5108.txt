Although most of the examples of this book focus on Fedora and RHEL, I have added many 
more references to Ubuntu through out the book in this edition.

To get Ubuntu, you can download a Live ISO image or installation medium from 
the Download Ubuntu page: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/
downloaddesktop.

Figure A.2 shows an example of the Download Ubuntu Desktop page.

Download Ubuntu Live CD ISO images, or choose an alternative download.

As with Fedora, the easiest way to download Ubuntu is to select the 64-bit Ubuntu Live CD, 
download it, and burn it.
