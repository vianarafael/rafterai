After it 
is installed, you can choose whether to start up the desktop when your computer 
boots or start it as needed.

 ■ For a very lightweight Linux system, such as one meant to run on less powerful 

computers, you can choose an efﬁ cient, though less feature-rich, window manager 
(such as twm or fluxbox) or a lightweight desktop environment (such as LXDE 
or Xfce).

 ■ For more robust computers, you can choose more powerful desktop environments 
(such as GNOME and KDE) that can do such things as watch for events to happen 
(such as inserting a USB ﬂ ash drive) and respond to those events (such as opening 
a window to view the contents of the drive).

 ■ You can have multiple desktop environments installed and you can choose which 
one to launch when you log in.
