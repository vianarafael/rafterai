A team interface is an 
aggregated interface made up of two or more links. It can provide greater throughput or link redundancy 
than a single interface. It can support active/passive, LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol), and VLANs 
(Virtual Local Area Networks) and other protocols.

A teaming has two main parts, a teamd daemon and runners.
