For Ubuntu, if you examine the /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf configuration file, you 
will see that the following bind-address directive is already there.

On CentOS, we open /etc/my.cnf in a text editor and add the following line under the [mysqld] 

section:

bind-address = 127.0.0.1

Here we are instructing the database server to listen only on the loopback address, which prevents other 

hosts from accessing our database.
