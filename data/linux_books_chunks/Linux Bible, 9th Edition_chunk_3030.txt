Here are a few lines from the smb.conf ﬁ le that 
relate to printer sharing:

[global]
     ...
  load printers = yes
  cups options = raw
; printcap name = /etc/printcap
; printing = cups
    ...
[printers]
        comment = All Printers
        path = /var/spool/samba
        browseable = yes
        writeable = no
        printable = yes

These example settings are the result of conﬁ guring Samba from the Samba Server 
Conﬁ guration window (system-config-samba) in Fedora.
