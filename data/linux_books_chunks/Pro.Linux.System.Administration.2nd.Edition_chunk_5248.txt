The â€“d option for curl allows us to send a data POST, which we 
send as a JSON-formatted query.

The result of this query can look like this:

{
  "took":2,
  "timed_out":false,
  "_shards": {
     "total":5,
     "successful":5,
     "failed":0
   },
  "hits":  {
    "total":74,
    "max_score":null,
    "hits":[...the events...]
  }
}

The first section tells us how long it took to run the query and that we successfully queried five shards.
