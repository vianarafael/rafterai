postfix uses a configuration option called 
alias_maps in the main.cf configuration file to specify a file that matches recipients to the user who 
will actually receive the e-mail. the default aliases file is usually /etc/aliases. inside this file youâ€™ll 
find a list of users like so:

user1:user2

here all mail for user1 will be redirected to user2, with each username separated by a colon.
