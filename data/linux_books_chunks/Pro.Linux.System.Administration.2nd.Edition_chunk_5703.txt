remember to consult the style guide for puppet at https://docs.puppet.com/guides/style_guide.html.

Relating Resources
Resources in Puppet also have the concept of relationships. For example, a service resource can be 
connected to the package that installs it. Using this, we could trigger a restart of the service when a new 
version of the package is installed.
