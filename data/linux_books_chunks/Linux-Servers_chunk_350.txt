The value
for expiry time says how long the slave server will answer to queries, without receiving
a zone update.

Below  an  example  of  how  to  use  nslookup  to  query  the  soa  record  of  a  zone  (linux-
training.be).

root@debian6:~# nslookup 
> set type=SOA
> server ns1.openminds.be
> linux-training.be
Server:         ns1.openminds.be
Address:        195.47.215.14#53

linux-training.be
        origin = ns1.openminds.be
        mail addr = hostmaster.openminds.be
        serial = 2321001133
        refresh = 14400
        retry = 3600
        expire = 604800
        minimum = 3600

Zone transfers only occur when the zone database was updated (meaning when one or more
resource records were added, removed or changed on the master server).
