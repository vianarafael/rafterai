Each resource 

managed by Puppet must be unique—for example, there can be only one resource called File['/etc/
passwd'].

The attributes of a resource describe the configuration details being managed, such as defining a 

particular user and the attributes of that user (e.g., the groups the user belongs to or the location of the user’s 
home directory).
