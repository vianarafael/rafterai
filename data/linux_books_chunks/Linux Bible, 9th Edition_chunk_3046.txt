After your network is conﬁ gured properly and a 
local printer is installed, sharing that printer over the network as a UNIX or SMB print

Exercises
Use these exercises to test your knowledge of conﬁ guring printers in Linux. These tasks 
assume you are running a Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux system (although some tasks 
work on other Linux systems as well).
