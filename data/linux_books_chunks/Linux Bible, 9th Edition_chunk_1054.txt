By default, output is sorted by process ID number.

$ ps -eo pid,user,uid,group,gid,vsz,rss,comm | less
  PID USER     GROUP      GID    VSZ   RSS COMMAND
    1 root     root         0  19324  1320 init
    2 root     root         0      0     0 kthreadd

If you want to sort by a speciÔ¨Å c column, you can use the sort= option.
