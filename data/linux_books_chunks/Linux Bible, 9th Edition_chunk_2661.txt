Recently, Ubuntu, RHEL, and Fedora distributions have made the move 
to the newer systemd daemon while maintaining backward compatibility to the classic 
SysVinit, Upstart, or BSD init daemons.

Upstart, available at http://upstart.ubuntu.com, was originally developed by 
Canonical, the parent of the Ubuntu distribution.
