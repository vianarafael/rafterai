If there isnâ€™t an icon in the directory you want to use, create your own (in one of 
those two formats) and assign it to the application.

A drawer is an icon that you can click to display other icons representing menus, applets, and 
launchers; it behaves just like a panel. Essentially, any item you can add to a panel you can 
add to a drawer.
