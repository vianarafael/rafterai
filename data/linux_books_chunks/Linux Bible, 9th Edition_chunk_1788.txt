Although emacs 
required that emacs-common be installed, emacs-common did not depend on emacs and 
could therefore stay on the system without breaking dependencies. Running yum remove 
emacs-common would have removed both packages.

An alternative method to remove a set of packages you have installed is to use the  history 
subcommand.
