If we 
donâ€™t unmount these, our fixed root filesystem cannot be unmounted, and a check will be forced again 
when we next boot up.

bash-2 # exit
# umount /mnt/proc
# umount /mnt/dev
# umount /mnt

We can now reboot the host using Ctrl+alt+delete, the reboot command, or the shutdown -r now 
command.
