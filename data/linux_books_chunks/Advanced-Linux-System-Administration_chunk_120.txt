Notice: When setting up a linux server as a router it is possible to switch on ip-forwarding 
at boot time by adding the following line to rc.local:

echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward 

However it is better to use the sysctl mechanism to switch ip-forwarding on every time the 
network interface is started.
