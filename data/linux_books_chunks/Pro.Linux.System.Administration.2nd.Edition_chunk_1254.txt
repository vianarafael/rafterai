You may have a web server and mail server, and you will probably have a file/print server (sometimes all 
these servers are actually one host). Undoubtedly, you will have a connection to the Internet, and you will 
probably want to share that connection with others in your organization.

The nature of your business and the work you do will heavily dictate how you choose to set up your 

network.
