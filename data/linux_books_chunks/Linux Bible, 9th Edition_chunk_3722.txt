NFS allows servers to designate speciﬁ c directories to make available to desig-
nated hosts and then allows client systems to connect to those directories by mounting 
them locally.

NFS can be secured using ﬁ rewall (iptables) rules, TCP wrappers (to allow and deny 
host access), and SELinux (to conﬁ ne how ﬁ le sharing protocols can share NFS resources).
