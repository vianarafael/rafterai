Try typing the following:

$ I=0
$ echo The value of I after increment is $((++I))
The value of I after increment is 1

7

$ echo The value of I before and after increment is $((I++)) and $I
The value of I before and after increment is 1 and 2

Repeat either of those commands to continue to increment the value of $I.

Although most elements of shell scripts are relatively freeform (where whitespace, such as spaces or tabs, is 
 insignifi cant), both let and expr are particular about spacing.
