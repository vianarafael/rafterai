In Fedora or RHEL, as root user from a Terminal window, open the /etc/auto.

master Ô¨Å le and look for the following line:

/net   -hosts

This causes the /net directory to act as the mount point for the NFS shared 
 directories you want to access on the network. (If there is a comment character 
at the beginning of that line, remove it.)
