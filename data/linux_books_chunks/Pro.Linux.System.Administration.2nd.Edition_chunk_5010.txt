We can change these numbers via the speed_min_limit and speed_max_limit entries in the /proc/sys/
dev/raid directory.

A more acceptable minimum speed would be 20,000K per second per disk, and you can set it using 

sysctl.

$ sudo sysctl -w dev.raid.speed_limit_min=20000

Setting the minimum too high will adversely affect performance of the system, so make sure you set this 
number lower than the maximum throughput the system can handle, divided by the number of disks in your 
RAID array.

The maximum, which can be changed by setting the dev.raid.speed_limit_max variable, is fairly high 
already.
