One of the most commonly used loops is the for...do loop. It 
iterates through a list of values, executing the body of the loop for each element in the list. 
The syntax and a few examples are presented here:

for VAR in LIST
do
    { body }
done

The for loop assigns the values in LIST to VAR one at a time. Then for each value, the 
body in braces between do and done is executed.
