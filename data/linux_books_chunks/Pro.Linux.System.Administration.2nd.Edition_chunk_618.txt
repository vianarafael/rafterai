We can also display sizes in a more human-readable format by 
adding the -h switch as follows:

$ ls -lh
-rw-rw-r--  1 jsmith jsmith  51K  2016-08- 17 23:47 myfile

On the previous line, you can see that the myfile file is 51 kibibytes in size.
In a listing, the size next to the directory is not its total size but rather the size of the directoryâ€™s 

metadata.
