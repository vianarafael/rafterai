With recent versions of bind (bind v9.7 and above), we can use auto key signing which will 
automatically sign and resign zones at the defined intervals. From version 9.9 onward we can use a feature 
called “inline” key signing.

There are two kinds of records we can create, NSEC and NSEC3. Depending on your requirements you 

can implement whichever is appropriate.
