The named ﬁ le or directory appears as those shown in this example:

$ ls -ld ch3 test
-rw-rw-r-- 1 joe sales 4983 Jan 18 22:13 ch3
drwxr-xr-x 2 joe sales 1024 Jan 24 13:47 test

The ﬁ rst line shows that the ch3 ﬁ le has read and write permission for the owner and the 
group. All other users have read permission, which means they can view the ﬁ le but cannot 
change its contents or remove it.
