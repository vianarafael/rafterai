While the keys can have prefixes (such as nightly/backupfile.zip, where nightly 
is the prefix and nightly/backupfile.zip is the key), they are not nested hierarchically but instead all live 
in the one bucket.

•	 We are going to set up an S3 bucket.

•	 We are to create a life-cycle version policy.

•	

Set the access policy to allow our backup user to put files in S3, list them, and get 
them.

When you have logged into the AWS web console for your account, you will need to make your way to 

the S3 service tab like in Figure 14-2.
