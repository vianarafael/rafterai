CONSISTENT DEVICE NAMING

what’s with the name enp0s3 or enp0s8? Previously when systems were booted their network devices 
would be probed by the driver and given a name like eth0. if there was more than one network device 
eth0 might be eth0 on one boot and eth1 on the next. this lead to obvious problems.
