Plans must be tested and updated to maintain their reliability in true disaster situations.

Disaster recovery plans should include these things:

 ■ What data is to be included in backups

 ■ Where backups are to be stored

 ■ How long backups are maintained

 ■ How backup media is rotated through storage

Backup data, media, and software should be included in your Access Control Matrix 
checklist.

It is important to determine how many backup copies of each object should be maintained.
