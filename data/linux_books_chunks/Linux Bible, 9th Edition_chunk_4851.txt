Storage needs for clouds 
include needing places to store the back-end storage for your VMs, images for launching 
VMs, and databases for storing information about the cloud itself.

Shared storage between hypervisors can be done as simply as creating an NFS share (see 
Chapter 20) and mounting it on the same mount point between multiple hypervisors.
