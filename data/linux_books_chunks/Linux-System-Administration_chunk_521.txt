This can be useful if you plan to remove a Physical Volume.

[root@RHEL5 ~]# pvchange -xn /dev/sdd
  Physical volume "/dev/sdd" changed
  1 physical volume changed / 0 physical volumes not changed
[root@RHEL5 ~]#

To revert your previous decision, this example shows you how te re-enable the Physical
Volume to allow allocation.

[root@RHEL5 ~]# pvchange -xy /dev/sdd
  Physical volume "/dev/sdd" changed
  1 physical volume changed / 0 physical volumes not changed
[root@RHEL5 ~]#
