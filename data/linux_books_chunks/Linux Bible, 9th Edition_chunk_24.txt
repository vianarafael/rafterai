For the new content I wrote in this book on Linux cloud 
technologies, Iâ€™d like to thank members of OpenStack, Docker, and RHEV teams, who help 
me learn cutting-edge cloud technology every day.

As for the people at Wiley, thanks for letting me continue to develop and improve this book 
over the years. Marty Minner has helped keep me on task through a demanding schedule.
