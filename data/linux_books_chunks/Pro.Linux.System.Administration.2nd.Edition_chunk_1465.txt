One such application to view this detail is the tcpdump command-line tool. The 
tcpdump command, and those like it, can view traffic at the packet level on the wire. You can see the packets 
coming in and out of your host. The tcpdump command, when run without any expressions, will print every 
packet crossing the interface.
