You can use the cd command to change the directory 

on the local gateway.example.com host if your files are located elsewhere.

We use the put command to also put the branch1.example.com.key and the cacert.pem CA certificate 
file onto the branch1 host. Since this is an Ubuntu server, weâ€™re now going to move our files to the /etc/ssl 
directory and secure their ownership and permissions.
