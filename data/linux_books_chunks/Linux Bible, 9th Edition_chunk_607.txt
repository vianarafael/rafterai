Notice that the equal 
sign immediately follows the option (no space) and then the argument (again, no space).

Here’s an example of a single-letter option that is followed by an argument:

$ tar -cvf backup.tar /home/chris

In the tar example just shown, the options say to create (c) a ﬁ le (f) named backup.tar 
that includes all the contents of the /home/chris directory and its subdirectories and 
show verbose messages as the backup is created (v).
