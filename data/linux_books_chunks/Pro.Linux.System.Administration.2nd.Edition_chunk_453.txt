Let’s type a command called 
whoami and execute it by pressing the Enter key:

$ whoami
jsmith

The whoami command returns the name of the user you are logged in as. You can see our host has 

returned jsmith. This tells us we’re logged in to our host as the user jsmith.

Each shell contains a series of built-in commands and functions to help you make use of the command 
line.
