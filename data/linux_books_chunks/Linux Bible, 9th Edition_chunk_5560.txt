If propa-
gation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction 
who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s 
predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to 
possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the 
predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or 
afﬁ rmed under this License.
