Then I created a 
500MB /boot partition and a 12GB swap partition, and I assigned the rest of the 
disk space to the root partition (/). The /var/lib/libvirt/images directory 
holds most of the data on this system, but that is a shared directory, available from 
another system on the network and shared between the two hypervisors.
