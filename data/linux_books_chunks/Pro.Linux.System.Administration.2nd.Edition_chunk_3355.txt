You can find a full list of mail clients 
and the authentication mechanisms they support at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_e-
mail_clients#Authentication_support.

Also in the 10-auth.conf file we determine which authentication service we will use. At the bottom of 

the file you will see that we include !include auth-system.conf.ext.
