For example:

# ping -c 2 192.168.0.1
PING 192.168.0.1 (192.168.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
From 192.168.0.105 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable
From 192.168.0.105 icmp_seq=2 Destination Host Unreachable
--- 192.168.0.1 ping statistics ---

2 packets transmitted, 0 received, +2 errors, 100% packet loss

The “Destination Host Unreachable” message tells you that the router is either turned off or 
not physically connected to you (maybe the router isn’t connected to the switch you share).
