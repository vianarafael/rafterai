To boot Linux this means booting
a gzip compressed zImage or bzip2 compressed bzImage.

This screenshot shows a kernel command used to load a Debian kernel.

kernel  /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17-2-686 root=/dev/hda1 ro

And this is how RHEL 5 uses the kernel command.

kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.18-128.el5 ro root=/dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 rhgb quiet

All parameters in the kernel line can be read by the kernel itself or by any other program
(which are started later) by reading /proc/cmdline

initrd

Many Linux installations will need an initial ramdisk at boot time.
