A certificate from a commercial CA can cost hundreds of dollars 
a year. This is a considerable expense just to secure your e-mail or your business marketing site. As a result, if 
you don’t want the expense of buying certificates, we recommend a Let’s Encrypt certificate.

If we choose a commercial certificate, we will need to create the private key and a certificate signing 

request (CSR).
