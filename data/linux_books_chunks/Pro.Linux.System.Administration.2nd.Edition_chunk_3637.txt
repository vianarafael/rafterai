It is based on the Common Internet Filesystem (CIFS) 
and Server Message Block (SMB) protocols, the protocols that handle interhost communications of the 
filesystem on Microsoft products, making Samba compatible with Microsoft Windows desktop clients and 
Microsoft Windows domain services.

There are currently two supported versions of Samba, version 3.x and version 4.x.
