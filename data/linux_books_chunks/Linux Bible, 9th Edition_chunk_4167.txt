Includes messages output by the X.Org X 
server.

The log ﬁ les that are in your system’s /var/log directory depend upon what services you 
are running. Also, some log ﬁ les are distribution-dependent. For example, if you use Fedora 
Linux, you would not have the dpkg log ﬁ le.

Most of the log ﬁ les are displayed using the commands cat, head, tail, more, or less.
