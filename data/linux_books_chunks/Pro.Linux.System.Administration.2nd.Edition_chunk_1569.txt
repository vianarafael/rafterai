Found in the nat, 
mangle, and raw tables.

Used to alter packets after they have left the other chains and are about to go out of 
the interface(s). Found in the nat and mangle tables only.

Each chain correlates to the basic paths that packets can take through a host. When the Netfilter logic 

encounters a packet, the first evaluation it makes is to which chain the packet is destined.
