Instead of adding an encrypted password here, you can simply 
use the passwd user command later to add a password for user. (To generate an 
encrypted MD5 password, type openssl passwd.)

 ■ -s shell—Specify the command shell to use for this account. Replace shell 

with the command shell (for example, -s /bin/csh).
