broadcast

A broadcast is meant for everyone.

Typical  example  here  is  the  BBC  (British  Broadcasting  Corporation)  broadcasting  to
everyone. In datacommunications a broadcast is most common confined to the lan.

Careful,  a  layer  2  broadcast  is  very  different  from  a  layer  3  broadcast.
