First, you need to make sure you have at least three disks and 
create identically sized partitions on all of them.

 â–  Note 
If you do not have enough disks to use raId, you can create multiple identically sized partitions on 
a single disk and use them as components in your raId array. this will allow you to test raId installation and 
management.
