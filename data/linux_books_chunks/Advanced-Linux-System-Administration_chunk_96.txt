You can backup the old changed file to a directory of your choice

mkdir oldfiles

patch -B oldfiles/ -p0 < patch-file

This has the advantage of letting you create a backup patch that can restore the source 
tree to it's original state.

diff -ur linux-2.4.21 oldfiles/linux-2.4.21  > recover-2.4.21-
patch

NOTICE

Applying this recover-2.4.21-patch will have the effect of removing the 
2.4.22 patch we just applied in the previous paragraph
