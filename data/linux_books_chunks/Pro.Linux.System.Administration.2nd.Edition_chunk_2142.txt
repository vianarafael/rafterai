once the book is in the return chute, the customer 
can go back to their business, knowing that the book has been safely accepted by the library. the 
librarian can process returned books when the library isn’t busy with people checking out new books. 
and even if the books in the chute aren’t processed before the library closes, they won’t get lost.
