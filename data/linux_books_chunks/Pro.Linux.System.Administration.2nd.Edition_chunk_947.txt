You can then refer to this alias in a configuration line.

ADMIN=/bin/userdel,/bin/useradd, \
(named) /usr/sbin/named

In the previous line we have specified that the users in the alias ADMIN are able to use the commands 

userdel, useradd, and named.

The next type of alias you can define is a command alias, Cmnd_Alias, which groups collections of 

commands.

Cmnd_Alias USER_COMMANDS = /bin/userdel,/bin/useradd

You can use this alias in conjunction with the user alias just created.

ADMIN ALL=/bin/groupadd,USER_COMMANDS

Now all users defined in the alias ADMIN can use the command /bin/groupadd and all those commands 

defined in the command alias USER_COMMANDS on ALL hosts.

You can also specify an alias that groups a collection of hosts.
