Before you begin, you must have the following:

 ■ DVD or CD ISO images—Download the ISO images to your computer that represent 
the physical DVD or CD you will ultimately burn. Today, many Linux ISO images are 
too big to ﬁ t on a DVD (including those for RHEL, Fedora, and Ubuntu).

 ■ Blank DVDs/CDs—You need blank DVDs or CDs to burn the images to.
