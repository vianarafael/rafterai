Using lvdisplay as follows, 
you can see where they have been allocated (I have snipped some of the output):

12

# lvdisplay vg_abc
  --- Logical volume ---
  LV Name                /dev/vg_abc/lv_root
  VG Name                vg_abc
  LV UUID                33VeDc-jd0l-hlCc-RMuB-tkcw-QvFi-cKCZqa

  --- Logical volume ---

  VG Name                vg_abc
  ...
  LV Size                92.64 GiB
  --- Logical volume ---
  LV Name                /dev/vg_abc/lv_swap
  VG Name                vg_abc
  ...
  LV Size                5.88 GiB

There are three logical volumes drawing space from vg_abc.
