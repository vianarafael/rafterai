A better way to change these values, however, is to use 
the usermod command (see the section “Modifying Users with usermod” in Chapter 11 for 
 further information).

At this point, any command you run from your shell is run with root privilege. So be 
 careful. You have much more power to change (and damage) the system than you did as a 
regular user.
