We’re going to ping the address used as the end of our VPN 
tunnel on the branch1 host, which we discovered earlier is 10.8.0.6.

[gateway]$ ping 10.8.0.6 -c 3
PING 10.8.0.6 (10.8.0.6) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.8.0.6: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.593 ms
64 bytes from 10.8.0.6: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.588 ms
64 bytes from 10.8.0.6: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.807 ms

The preceding code shows us that the gateway host can see the branch1 host using ICMP and the 

10.8.0.6 IP address on that branch1 host responds to ICMP traffic.

We can do the same thing from the branch1 host by trying to ping IP address 10.8.0.1 on the gateway 

host end.

branch1$
ping 10.8.0.1 -c 3
PING 10.8.0.1 (10.8.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.8.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.682 ms
64 bytes from 10.8.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.672 ms
64 bytes from 10.8.0.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.751 ms

If both ends respond, then your VPN is up, and you can use it to route traffic to and from your branch 

office to your head office.

If you now want, you can repeat this configuration for any additional branch offices.
