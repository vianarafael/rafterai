For example, to display any configuration options that 
have been changed from the default (i.e., modified for your host), you can use the –n configuration flag.

$ sudo postconf -n

if you are looking for troubleshooting, you will be usually asked to provide the output of the postconf -n 
command. You can also display every configuration option and its default setting using the –d flag.
