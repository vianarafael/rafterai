The following is an example of a /etc/inittab Ô¨Å le on 
a Linux server that uses systemd.

# cat /etc/inittab
# inittab is no longer used when using systemd.
#
# ADDING CONFIGURATION HERE WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON YOUR SYSTEM.
#
# Ctrl-Alt-Delete is handled by
# /etc/systemd/system/ctrl-alt-del.target

Chapter 15: Starting and Stopping Services

# systemd uses 'targets' instead of runlevels.
# By default, there are two main targets:
#
# multi-user.target: analogous to runlevel 3
# graphical.target: analogous to runlevel 5
#
# To set a default target, run:
#
# ln -s /lib/systemd/system/<target name>.target
# /etc/systemd/system/default.target

The /etc/inittab explains that if you want something similar to a classic 3 or 5  runlevel 
as your default runlevel, you need to create a symbolic link from the default.
