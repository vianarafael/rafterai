hostname

Every host receives a hostname, often placed in a DNS name space forming the fqdn or
Fully Qualified Domain Name.

This screenshot shows the hostname command and the configuration of the hostname on
Red Hat/Fedora.

[root@rhel6 ~]# grep HOSTNAME /etc/sysconfig/network
HOSTNAME=rhel6
[root@rhel6 ~]# hostname
rhel6
