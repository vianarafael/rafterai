To do both of these things, we’re going to update a Postfix option 
called home_mailbox like so:

home_mailbox = Maildir/

or using the postconf command, like so:

$ sudo postconf -e "home_mailbox = Maildir/"

The home_mailbox option tells Postfix the location of the user’s mailbox, relative to the user’s home 

directory, so that Maildir/ translates to /home/ataylor/Maildir.

 the trailing / is important.
