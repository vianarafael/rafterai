RAM is like the top of your 
desk, where you put the folder of papers while you are using it, but you put it back in the 
ﬁ le cabinet when you are not.

If RAM ﬁ lls up, by running too many processes or a process with a memory leak, new 
 processes fail if your system doesn’t have a way to extend system memory. That’s where a 
swap area comes in.
