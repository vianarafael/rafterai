if we collect these 
messages and pass them to the audit2allow program, we will be able to create the policy package we 
need to allow the correct access.

sudo grep "denied" /var/log/audit/audit.log |grep clamav | audit2allow -M clamav-
write

this command will create clamav-write.te and clamav-write.pp, which you can then load in via the 
following:

sudo semodule -i clamav-write.pp

For apparmor it is a different concept.
