When a test expression is evaluated, it returns either a value 
of 0, meaning that it is true, or a 1, meaning that it is false. Notice that the echo lines are 
indented. The indentation is optional and done only to make the script more readable.

Table 7.1 lists the conditions that are testable and is quite a handy reference.
