For example, to 
direct the output of messages that are being sent to the messages, secure, and maillog 
log ﬁ les to a loghost as well, add the bolded lines to the messages ﬁ le:

# Log anything (except mail) of level info or higher.
# Don't log private authentication messages!
*.info;mail.none;news.none;authpriv.none;cron.none  /var/log/messages
*.info;mail.none;news.none;authpriv.none;cron.none  @loghost
# The authpriv file has restricted access.
authpriv.*                                /var/log/secure
authpriv.*                                @loghost
# Log all the mail messages in one place.
mail.*                                     -/var/log/maillog
mail.*                                    @loghost

The messages are now sent to the rsyslogd running on the computer named loghost.
