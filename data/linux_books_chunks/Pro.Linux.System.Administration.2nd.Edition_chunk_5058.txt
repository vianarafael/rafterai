FSS key generation and QR code 

As the text in Figure 18-1 says, we should store the secret verification key in a safe place, and it gives us 

the handy ability to use the QR code to store it on our phone. The signing key has been place in the fss file in 
the /var/log/journal/ e3c7f…db6ab/ directory.
