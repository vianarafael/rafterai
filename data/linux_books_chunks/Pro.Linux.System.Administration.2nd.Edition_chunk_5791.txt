When the 
distribution is not ubuntu, this task will be skipped.

if we had a data structure like this:

our_config: {
    our_url:  ‘https://endpoint.example.com’

}

then we could use a complex conditional like this in our Jinja2 template file to make sure our urL is 
given the default value if it is not declared.

{% if our_config["our_url"] is not defined -%}
  url: {{ our_url | default('https://www.example.com') }}
{% endif %}

here we are saying if the associative array our_config does not have the key our_url defined, then 
we should get the default urL of https://www.example.com.
