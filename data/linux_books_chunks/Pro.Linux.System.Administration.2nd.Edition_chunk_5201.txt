Let’s see how we can 
collect our log file from the gateway host and any other Beats service.

$ sudo vi /etc/logstash/conf.d/general.conf
input {
  beats {
    port => 5044
    ssl  => true
    ssl_certificate => “/etc/ssl/certs/monitor.example.com.cert”
    ssl_key => “/etc/ssl/private/monitor.example.com.key”
    ssl_certificate_authorities [ “/etc/ssl/certs/cacert.pem” ]
    ssl_verify_mode => force_peer
  }
}
output {
  stdout { codec => rubydebug }
}

Taking a look at this file, you can see that it is made of two sections: an input and an output.
