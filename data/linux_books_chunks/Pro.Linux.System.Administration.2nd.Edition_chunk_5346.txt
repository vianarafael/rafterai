define command{
          command_name      host-notify-by-email
           command_line    /usr/bin/printf "%b" "***** Nagios *****\n\nNotification Type: 
$NOTIFICATIONTYPE$\nHost: $HOSTNAME$\nState: $HOSTSTATE$\nAddress: $HOSTADDRESS$\nInfo: 
$HOSTOUTPUT$\n\nDate/Time: $LONGDATETIME$\n" | /usr/bin/mail -s "** $NOTIFICATIONTYPE$ Host 
Alert: $HOSTNAME$ is $HOSTSTATE$ **" $CONTACTEMAIL$
   }

Like the previous command you saw, a name is provided with the command_name attribute, and the 

actual command to be executed by the command_line attribute.
