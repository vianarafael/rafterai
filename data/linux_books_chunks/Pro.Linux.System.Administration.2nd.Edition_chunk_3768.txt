You can use the showmount command to check your 
NFS shares by issuing the following:

$ sudo showmount -e localhost
Export list for localhost:
/data/staff 192.168.0

You can see that the output shows our NFS mount and the host IP address that can connect to it.
On the remote host, 192.168.0.2, we need to issue the following command to mount the share  

/data/staff to /data/remote (/data/remote needs to exist prior to running this command):

$ sudo mount -t nfs4 -o rw,intr,hard 192.168.0.1:/data/staff /data/remote

This will mount the /data/staff directory to the /data/remote directory on the remote host.
