As youâ€™ve discovered, both CentOS and Ubuntu store their log files in the /var/log directory but use 
different file names to store different types of log entries; for example, you saw in Chapter 12 (and you can 
see in the preceding 50-default.conf configuration file) that Ubuntu stores mail-related rsyslog entries 
in the mail.log file.
