These blocks take the following form:

<locationtag specifier>
(options specific to objects matching the specifier go within this 
   block)
</locationtag>

Different types of location tags exist and are selected based on the type of resource 
 location that is being speciﬁ ed. The speciﬁ er included in the start tag is handled based on 
the type of location tag.
