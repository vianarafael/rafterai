This service is able to install bare-metal Ubuntu and CentOS serversâ€”as well as 
RHEL and Windows.

The MAAS service strives to provide cloud functionality on your metal servers. The technology 
underlying this tool is not new. It uses PXE, Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), and Debian Preseed to 
build up nodes.
