If we look at the contents of that file it looks very 
much like Ruby code. That is because it is. This file uses Ruby code and Vagrant parses and loads this file 
when executing Vagrant commands. That means that you can use the Ruby language in the file to create lists, 
arrays, hashes, and so on. That becomes useful later on when working with more than one image in your 
Vagrantfile.
