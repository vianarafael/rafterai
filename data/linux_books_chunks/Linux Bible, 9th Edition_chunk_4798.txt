No rules are 
set, and the policies are all set to ACCEPT.

# iptables -vnL
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

First, what would happen if the INPUT policy was changed from ACCEPT to DROP? Would 
that reach the goal? Look at what happens when this is tried.
