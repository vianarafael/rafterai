Letâ€™s edit 

the file like so:

cluster.name: monitor
node.name: monitor-node-1

Also within the elasticsearch.yml file, we can set the data path where we store data, the log directory, 

network options, and so on.

For service discovery, or how Elasticsearch finds other nodes in the cluster, Elasticsearch has a Zen 

Discovery module.
