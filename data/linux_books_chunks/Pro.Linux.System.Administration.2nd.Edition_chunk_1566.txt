Each of the Netfilter tables, filter, nat, mangle, raw and security, contain sets of predefined hooks that 
Netfilter will process in order. These hooks contain sequenced groupings of rules called chains. Each table 
contains default chains that are built into the table. The built-in chains are described in TableÂ 7-5.
