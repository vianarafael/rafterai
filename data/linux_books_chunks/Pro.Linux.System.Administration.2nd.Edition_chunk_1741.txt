We are going to set up a PPP 
xDSL connection, which is a common way to connect to an ISP.

The most common way to set up an xDSL connection on Linux without the NetworkManager is to use 
the Roaring Penguin PPPoE client. To do so, first you will need to check that you have this client installed. On 
CentOS, again we will use nmcli to create our connection.
