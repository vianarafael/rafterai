The menuentry will 
be slightly different for an Ubuntu host. Normally you see at least two menu entries per kernel you have 
installed, with one entry being a “rescue” kernel for system recovery. It is a copy of the kernel in case one 
is corrupted on CentOS with no special kernel options. Ubuntu is different as it passes the recovery and 
nomodeset kernel options.
