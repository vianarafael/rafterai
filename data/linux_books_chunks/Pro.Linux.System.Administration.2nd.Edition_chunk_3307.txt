By specifying both smtp_tls_security_level and smtpd_
tls_security_level, we are telling Postfix we want to potentially encrypt both incoming and outgoing 
connections.

The may value for both options enables a mode called opportunistic TLS. This basically means that if 
TLS is supported by the remote client or server, it should be used. Otherwise, plain-text connections are 
acceptable.
