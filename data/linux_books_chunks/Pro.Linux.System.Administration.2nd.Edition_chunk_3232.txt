If youâ€™re domain is not listed here in mydestination, you will 
receive something like this when you send mail to a user:

RCPT TO: <bobby@unlisted.org>
554 5.7.1 <bobby@unlisted.org>: Relay access denied

Next, we need to add our local networks to the mynetworks configuration option. This tells Postfix 
what trusted IP address ranges SMTP clients will have to process e-mail.
