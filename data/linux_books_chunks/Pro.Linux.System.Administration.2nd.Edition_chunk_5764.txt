We can cater for these kinds 
of differences in our host file by adding the following variable declaration:

[all_ubuntu:vars]
ansible_user=ubuntu

[all_centos:vars]
ansible_user=vagrant

You will notice that hosts in the [dbs] group have not been declared as either Ubuntu or CentOS, so we 

can manage those hosts with this similar declaration.

[dbs]
db.example.com ansible_user=vagrant

We may also want particular hosts to be reached via a particular jumphost (sometimes called a bastion 

or proxy).
