Vagrantfileâ€”Adding Forwarded Ports

Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
 config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
 config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
end

In Listing 3-6 you can see we are adding the forwarded port by setting the config.vm.network. We can 

also synchronize folders from our host to our guest hosts. This is invaluable when developing.
