Suppose the / partition needs to be enlarged on the target system.
The best option then is to use a combination of dump and restore. Remember that dd copies
blocks, whereas dump/restore copies files.

The first step to do is to boot the target server with a live CD and partition the target disk.
To do this we use the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 install CD.
