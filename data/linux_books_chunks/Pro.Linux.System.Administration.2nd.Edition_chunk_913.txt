You can also specify a module from another location here by providing the path to it, as you can see in the 
following line:

auth required /usr/local/pamlib/pam_local.so id=-1 root=1

The last directives are arguments to be passed to the PAM moduleâ€”in this case, we are passing the 

arguments try_first_pass and nullok to the pam_unix.so module.
