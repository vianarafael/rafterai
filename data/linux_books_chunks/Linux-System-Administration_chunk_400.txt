Then umount, and mount the file system as read only on /srv/nfs/salesnumbers. Where
are the files you copied ?

mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
cp -r /etc /mnt
ls -l /mnt

umount /mnt
ls -l /mnt

mkdir -p /srv/nfs/salesnumbers
mount /dev/sdb1 /srv/nfs/salesnumbers

You see the files in /srv/nfs/salenumbers now...

But physically they are on ext3 on partition /dev/sdb1
