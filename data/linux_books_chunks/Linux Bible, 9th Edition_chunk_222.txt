Sun Microsystems was selling lots of UNIX 
 workstations (originally based on BSD but merged with UNIX in SVR4) for programmers and 
high-end technology applications (such as stock trading).

Other commercial UNIX systems were also emerging by the 1980s as well. This new 
 ownership assertion of UNIX was beginning to take its toll on the spirit of open 
 contributions.
