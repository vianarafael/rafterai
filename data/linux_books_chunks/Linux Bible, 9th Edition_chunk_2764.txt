Using both commands in the example that follows, you can view the 
cups daemonâ€™s settings.

# chkconfig --list cups
cups            0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off
# service cups status
cupsd (pid 1988) is running...

You can see that the cupsd daemon is set to start on every runlevel but 0, 1, and 6, and 
from the service command, you can see that it is currently running.
