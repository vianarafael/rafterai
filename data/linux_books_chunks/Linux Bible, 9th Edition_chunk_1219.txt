Part II: Becoming a Linux Power User

So, if you created the telephone list Ô¨Å le as ph in your current directory, you could type the 
following from the shell to try out your ph script:

$ chmod 755 ph
$ ./ph new "Mary Jones" 608-555-1212
Mary Jones 608-555-1212 added to database
$ ./ph Mary
Mary Jones 608-555-1212

The chmod command makes the ph script executable.
