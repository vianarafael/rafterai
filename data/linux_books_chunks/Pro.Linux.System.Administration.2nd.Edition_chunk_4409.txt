We add another chain for our mobile VPN tunnel.

[gateway]$ sudo firewall-cmd --zone public --permanent --add-interface tun1

Now we have reload the firewall configuration.

[gateway]$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload

Weâ€™ve created a variety of simple rules to allow traffic through the VPN tunnel and forward it into our 

internal network.
