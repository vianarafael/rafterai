The reason you can use Alt+SysRq keystrokes on an otherwise 
unresponsive system is that the kernel processes Alt+SysRq requests ahead of other 
requests.

To enable Alt+SysRq keystrokes, the system must have already set /proc/sys/
kernel/sysrq to 1. An easy way to do this is to add kernel.sysrq = 1 
to the /etc/sysctl.conf Ô¨Å le.
