Ext3, ext4, and XFS are such journaled filesystems, and thus don’t have the 
long recovery wait time that ext2 does. See the sidebar “Journaled Filesystems” for more information.

With lessons learned from ext3, a further advancement, ext4, was developed. It offers some features not 
available in ext3, such as online defragmentation, better journal reliability, and faster filesystem checks.
