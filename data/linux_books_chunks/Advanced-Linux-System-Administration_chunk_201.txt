CD Burners and Linux

Hardware detection

The tools available on the commandline to burn CDs assume that the CD writer is a SCSI 
device.  However most cheaper CD burners are IDE devices. The 2.4 kernels get around 
this by providing a ide-scsi.o module to drive the CD burner device. 

If you run cdrecord with the -scanbus option you will see that the tool is looking for a 
SCSI device.
