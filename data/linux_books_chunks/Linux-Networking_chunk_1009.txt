ISP

Should you be so lucky to get an ipv6 address from an isp, then it will start with 2001:.

25.10. non routable addresses

Comparable to example.com for DNS, the following ipv6 address ranges are reserved for
examples, and not routable on the internet.

3fff:ffff::/32
2001:0db8::/32

25.11. ping6

Use ping6 to test connectivity between ipv6 hosts.
