A variety of files are present.

The files like ifcfg-enp0s3 are configuration files, or connection profiles, for the Ethernet interfaces. 
The files with the naming convention of if<action>-device, for example, ifdown-ppp, are scripts that are 
used to control the state (i.e., bring the interface up or down).

We talked about NetworkManager previously.
