First we list to see whether the folder exists.

$ doveadm mailbox list -u jsmith
INBOX

In this case it doesnâ€™t, so we are going to create it.

$ doveadm mailbox create -u jsmith Spam
$ doveadm mailbox list -u jsmith
Spam
INBOX

Next, when we send our test spam e-mail like we did previously, we will now see the following:

Aug 28 05:17:10 ip-10-0-10-154 dovecot: lmtp(18407): Connect from local
Aug 28 05:17:10 ip-10-0-10-154 dovecot: lmtp(18407, jsmith): Kl1sKRaswlfnRwAArNTl4g: sieve: 
msgid=<20160828091710.A40A21811885@mail.example.com>: stored mail into mailbox 'Spam'
Aug 28 05:17:10 ip-10-0-10-154 dovecot: lmtp(18407): Disconnect from local: Successful quit

Excellent.
