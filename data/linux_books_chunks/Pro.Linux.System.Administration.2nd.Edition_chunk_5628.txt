to install these modules, you can use something like r10k (https://docs.puppet.com/pe/
latest/r10k.html) to help manage the installation of your modules.

You can use the puppet module command to manage modules as well. the puppet module command 
will create skeleton modules for you, search for existing modules from the puppet forge, install 
modules, and manage the life cycle of modules for you.
