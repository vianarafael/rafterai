The 

key is 2,048 bits long, which is the current standard for the Internet but can be higher if you want. The issue 
is that some CAs will not support larger key lengths.

 â–  Note 
 higher key lengths increase the security of your encryption, but there is a (slight) processing penalty, 
and doubling the key does not result in double the encryption security.
