As you 
can see, crontab on this particular Linux system is PAM-aware.

# ldd /usr/bin/crontab | grep pam
libpam.so.0 => /lib/libpam.so.0 (0x44d12000)

The beneﬁ ts of using PAM on your Linux system include the following:

 ■ Simpliﬁ ed and centralized authentication management from the administrator 

viewpoint

 ■ Simpliﬁ ed application development, because developers can write applications using 
the documented PAM library, instead of writing their own authentication routines

 ■ Flexibility in authentication:

 ■ Allow or deny access to resources based on traditional criteria, such as identiﬁ cation

 ■ Allow or deny access based on additional criteria, such as time of day restrictions

 ■ Set subject limitations, such as resource usage

Although the beneﬁ ts of PAM simplify authentication management, the way PAM actually 
works is not so simple.

Understanding the PAM authentication process
When a subject (user or process) requests access to a PAM-aware application or utility, two 
primary components are used to complete the subject authentication process:

 ■ The PAM-aware application’s conﬁ guration ﬁ le

 ■ The PAM modules the conﬁ guration ﬁ le uses

Each PAM-aware application conﬁ guration ﬁ le is at the center of the process.
