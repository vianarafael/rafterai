Any command you specify in the command option 
must be defined with its full path. You can also specify more than one command, each separated by 
commas, to be authorized for use, as you can see on the following line:

ataylor ALL=/bin/userdel,/bin/useradd

In the previous line, ataylor is now authorized to use the userdel and useradd commands as if she 
were the root user.
