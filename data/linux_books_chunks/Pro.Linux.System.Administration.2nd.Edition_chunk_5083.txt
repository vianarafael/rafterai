syslog is both a series of 
programs and libraries, including rsyslogd, the rsyslog daemon, and a communications protocol.

The most frequently used component of rsyslog is the rsyslogd daemon. This daemon runs on your 

system from startup and listens for messages from your operating system and applications. It is important to 
note that the rsyslogd daemon is a passive tool.
