Putting dns and icmp would render nothing
because there is no packet that matches both protocols.

In the screenshot above you can see that packets 25 and 26 both have 10.104.33.30 as source
and destination ip address. That is because the dns client is the same computer as the dns
server.

The same is true for packets 31 and 32, since the machine is actually pinging itself.
