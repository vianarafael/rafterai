With a blank CD inserted and the ISO image you want to burn 
in the current directory, you can use the following simple command line for burning a CD 
image to CD using cdrecord:

# cdrecord -v whatever.iso

See the cdrecord man page (man cdrecord) for other options available with the 
 cdrecord command.

Booting Linux from a USB Drive
Instead of burning ISO images to a CD or DVD, you can put your Linux system on a USB 
drive.
