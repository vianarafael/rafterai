Chapter 22: Understanding Basic Linux Security 

The following are also stored in the /etc/shadow ﬁ le, in addition to the account name 
and hashed password:

 ■ Number of days (since January 1, 1970) since the password was changed

 ■ Number of days before password can be changed

 ■ Number of days before a password must be changed

 ■ Number of days to warn a user before a password must be changed

 ■ Number of days after password expires that an account is disabled

 ■ Number of days (since January 1, 1970) that an account has been disabled

These should sound familiar because they are the settings for password aging covered ear-
lier in the chapter.
