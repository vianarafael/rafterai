For example, the location of the Nagios log file is specified 
using the log_file option; on CentOS, this would be done as follows:

log_file=/var/log/nagios/nagios.log

This is usually the first option in your nagios.cfg file followed by the cfg_file and cfg_dir options 

that specify the location of your object configuration files.
