Instead, you might have to reach the Internet via a proxy server. 
Instead of allowing you full access to the Internet, a proxy server lets you make requests 
only for certain services outside the local network. The proxy server then passes those 
requests on to the Internet or other network.

Proxy servers typically provide access to web servers (http:// and https://) and FTP 
servers (ftp://).
