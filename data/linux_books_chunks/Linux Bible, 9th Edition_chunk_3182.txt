Some popular CAs include InstantSSL 
(http://www.instantssl.com), Thawte (http://www.thawte.com), and Symantec 
(http://www.symantec.com/ssl-certificates#).

You also have the option of creating self-signed certiﬁ cates, although these should be 
used only for testing or when a very small number of people will be accessing your server 
and you do not plan to have certiﬁ cates on multiple machines.
