On Fedora and RHEL systems, 
in particular, SELinux features need to be changed to allow users to access their home 
 directories if you are in SELinux Enforcing mode.

For example, if you tried to use smbclient to log in to your home directory, the login 
would succeed, but when you tried to list the contents of the home directory, you might 
see the following message:

NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED listing \*

To tell SELinux to allow Samba users to access their home directories as Samba shares, turn 
on the samba_enable_home_dirs Boolean by typing the following as root from a shell:

# setsebool -P samba_enable_home_dirs on

The setsebool command turns on the capability of Samba to share home directories 
(which is off by default).
