Managing “hand-rolled” kernels can be a burden to patch and update, sometimes leaving you with a 
system you can’t update.

When you do update your kernel you will need to reboot for critical patches. in version 4 of the Linux 
kernel, a way of patching the kernel to no longer require a reboot, even for critical patches, has been 
committed since 2015.
