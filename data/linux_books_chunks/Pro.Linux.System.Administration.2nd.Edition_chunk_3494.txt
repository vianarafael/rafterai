For Ubuntu you find the files in /etc/clamav.

For CentOS we want to remove the word Example from /etc/mail/clamav-milter.conf and set the 

following:

MilterSocket /var/run/clamav-milter/clamav-milter.socket
MilterSocketGroup mail
MilterSocketMode 660
AllowSupplementaryGroups yes
ClamdSocket unix:/var/run/clamd.scan/clamd.sock
OnInfected Accept
AddHeader Add
ReportHostname mail.example.com

In the previous lines, we have set some configuration options like socket files for clamav-milter and the 

socket we talk to the scanner (clamd) on.
