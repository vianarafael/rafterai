(The last two zeros conﬁ gure the system to not dump the contents of the 
ﬁ lesystem and to not run fsck on the ﬁ lesystem.)

The following are examples of NFS entries in /etc/fstab:

maple:/stuff   /mnt/maple nfs   bg,rsize=8192,wsize=8192  0 0
oak:/apps      /oak/apps  nfs   noauto,ro                 0 0

In the ﬁ rst example, the remote directory /stuff from the computer named maple 
(maple:/stuff) is mounted on the local directory /mnt/maple (the local directory must 
already exist).
