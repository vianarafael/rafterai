The advantage of symmetric key cryptography is speed. The disadvantage is the need to 
share the single key if the encrypted data is to be decrypted by another person.

An example of symmetric key cryptography on a Linux system is accomplished using 
the OpenPGP utility, GNU Privacy Guard, gpg2. The gnupg2 package is installed by 
default in Fedora and RHEL.
