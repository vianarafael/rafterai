The virtual_mailbox file has a similar syntax.

/etc/postfix/virt_mailbox:
ataylor@example.com    OK
ataylor@example.net    OK
bsingh@example.com     OK
jsmith@example.net     OK

Here we are listing the e-mail addresses we accept. Again, we could set other actions instead of OK such 

as REJECT or FILTER or BCC.

Finally, we can also use virtual aliases like we did with the /etc/aliases file.
