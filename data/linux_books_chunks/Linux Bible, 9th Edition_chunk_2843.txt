Add the service to a speciﬁ c runlevel.

Step 1: Create a new or customized service script file
If you are customizing a service script, simply make a copy of the original unit ﬁ le from
/etc/rc.d/init.d and add any desired customizations.

If you are creating a new script, you need to make sure you handle all the various options 
you want the service command to accept for your service, such as start, stop, 
restart, and so on.

For a new script, especially if you have never created a service script before, it would be 
wise to make a copy of a current service script from /etc/rc.d/init.d and modify it 
to meet your new service’s needs.
