The following 
examples show variables set to a string of characters (CITY) and a numeric value (PI):

CITY="Springfield"
PI=3.14159265

Variables can contain the output of a command or command sequence. You can accomplish 
this by preceding the command with a dollar sign and open parenthesis, and following it 
with a closing parenthesis.
