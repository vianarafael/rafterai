To do this, we need to edit the 

following:

$ sudo vi /etc/systemd/journal-remote.conf
[Remote]
ServerKeyFile=/etc/pki/tls/private/backup.example.com.key
ServerCertificateFile=/etc/pki/tls/certs/backup.example.com.cert
TrustedCertificateFile=/etc/pki/tls/certs/cacert.pem

This provides the details of the TLS keys and certs we need.
