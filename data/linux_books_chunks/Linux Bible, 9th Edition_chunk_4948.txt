After a bit of time for the memory image of the VM to copy 
over to the other host, the VM should appear as running on that host.

If, for some reason, your migration fails (incompatible CPUs or other problems), you can 
always shut down the VM on one host and start it again on the other host. Doing that 
only requires that your shared storage is in place.
