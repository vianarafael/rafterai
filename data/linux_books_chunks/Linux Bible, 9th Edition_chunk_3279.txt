If you start vsftpd as it is delivered with Fedora, this is what you get:

 ■ The vsftpd service starts the vsftpd daemon, which runs in the background.

 ■ The standard port on which the vsftpd daemon listens is TCP port 21. By default, 
data is transferred to the user, after the connection is made, on TCP port 20.
