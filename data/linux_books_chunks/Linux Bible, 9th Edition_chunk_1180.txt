The last command gets a random number between 0 and 10 and echoes the 
results back to you.

BIGNUM=1024
let RESULT=$BIGNUM/16
RESULT=`expr $BIGNUM / 16`
RESULT=`echo "$BIGNUM / 16" | bc`
let foo=$RANDOM; echo $foo

Another way to incrementally grow a variable is to use $(()) notation with ++I added to 
increment the value of I.
