Facilities tell you the source of log messages; for 
example, the mail facility is used for log messages related to mail services such as Postfix. A number of 
facilities are available, and weâ€™ll look at each in the next section. Each application specifies the facility it will 
use for its log entries.

The priority (.*) tells rsyslog the importance of the message being sent.
