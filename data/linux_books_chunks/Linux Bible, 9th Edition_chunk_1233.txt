Sophisticated 
networking protocols and applications make it possible for a Linux system to extend its capabilities 
to network users and computers around the world. The person assigned to manage all of a Linux 
systemâ€™s resources is called the system administrator.

Even if you are the only person using a Linux system, system administration is still set up to be 
separate from other computer use.
