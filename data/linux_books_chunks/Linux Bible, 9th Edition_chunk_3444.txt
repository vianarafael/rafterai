File contexts must be properly set on a directory that is 
shared by Samba. Booleans allow you to override the secure-by-default approach to 
certain Samba features.

You can ﬁ nd information on how SELinux conﬁ nes Samba on the samba_selinux man 
page (man samba_selinux). You must install the selinux-policy-devel package to 
get that man page.
