This time, the policy name is passed to it, as shown in the following example:

# getsebool httpd_can_connect_ftp
httpd_can_connect_ftp --> off

To toggle a policy, you can use either the setsebool command or the togglebool com-
mand. Both of these commands change the policy rule temporarily. When the system is 
rebooted, the Boolean returns to its original setting.
