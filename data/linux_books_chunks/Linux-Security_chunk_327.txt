inode and file contents

Let's put some data in one of the files.

paul@RHELv4u4:~/test$ ls -li
total 16
817266 -rw-rw-r--  1 paul paul  0 Feb  5 15:38 file1
817270 -rw-rw-r--  1 paul paul 92 Feb  5 15:42 file2
817268 -rw-rw-r--  1 paul paul  0 Feb  5 15:38 file3
paul@RHELv4u4:~/test$ cat file2
It is winter now and it is very cold.
We do not like the cold, we prefer hot summer nights.
paul@RHELv4u4:~/test$

The data that is displayed by the cat command is not in the inode, but somewhere else on
the disk.
