The final test is to go to a Microsoft windows computer and read a file on the Samba server.
First we use the net use command to mount the pubread share on the driveletter k.

C:\>net use K: \\teacher0\pubread
The command completed successfully.

Then we test looking at the contents of the share, and reading the files.

C:\>dir k:
 Volume in drive K is pubread
 Volume Serial Number is 0C82-11F2

 Directory of K:\

21/01/2009  05:49    <DIR>          .
21/01/2009  05:49    <DIR>          ..
21/01/2009  05:49                17 summer.txt
21/01/2009  05:49                18 winter.txt
               2 File(s)             35 bytes
               2 Dir(s)  13.496.242.176 bytes free

K:\>echo very cold > winter.txt
Access is denied.
