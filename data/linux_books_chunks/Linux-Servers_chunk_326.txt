dns zones

A zone (aka a zone of authority) is a portion of the DNS tree that covers one domain name
or child domain name. The picture below represents zones as blue ovals. Some zones will
contain delegate authority over a child domain to another zone.

A dns server can be authoritative over 0, 1 or more dns zones.
