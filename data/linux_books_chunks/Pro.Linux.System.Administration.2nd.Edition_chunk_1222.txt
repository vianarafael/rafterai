Commonly, you will find maintenance-type tasks in the crontabs. These 
can be scheduled to run nightly, weekly, or monthly and perform some kind of script, like one that deletes all 
files in the /var/ log/httpd directory older than two months.

Cron jobs (the tasks that crontab performs) are defined in a series of scripts under the directories 

defined in the /etc/crontab file.
