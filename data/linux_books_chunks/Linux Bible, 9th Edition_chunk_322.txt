You are graded on how well you 
obtained the results of those tasks.

If you plan to take the exams, check back to the exam objectives pages often, because they 
change from time to time. Keep in mind also that the RHCSA is a standalone certiﬁ cation; 
however, you must pass the RHCSA and the RHCE exams to get an RHCE certiﬁ cation.
