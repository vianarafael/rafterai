The hardware ethernet option specifies the MAC address that will have the address specified with the 
fixed-address option assigned to it.

 ■ Note  You can find out the MaC address for a network interface via the ip link show command.

This option can contain either an IP address or a resolvable FQDN. We’ll use the FQDN, as DNS is 

working fine for us.
