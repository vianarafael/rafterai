Using sudoers, for any users or groups on the system, you can do 
the following:

 ■ Assign root privilege for any command they run with sudo.

 ■ Assign root privilege for a select set of commands.

 ■ Give users root privilege without telling them the root password because they only 

have to provide their own user password to gain root privilege.

 ■ Allow users, if you choose, to run sudo without entering a password at all.

 ■ Track which users have run administrative commands on your system.
