Copying Files

$ cp /home/jsmith/myfile /home/jsmith/yourfile

In Listing 4-16, weâ€™ve copied the file /home/jsmith/myfile to /home/jsmith/yourfile. You need to 
be a little bit careful with the cp command. By default, the cp command will copy over existing files without 
prompting you. This can be bad if you already have a file with the same name as the one you are copying to.
