In IN_public_allow we have rule 
that allows our ssh connections.

-A IN_public_allow -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT

To explain this line, letâ€™s suppose we are going to initiate an incoming connection to our local SSH 
service on our host. The initial incoming packet will contain the the SYN flag to try to initiate a socket.
