To do this, we adjust the smtp 

service in the master.cf file like so:

smtp     inet     n     -     n     -     -     smtpd
    -o content_filter=spamassassin

Chapter 12 â–  Mail ServiCeS

This adds the line -o content_filter=spamassassin (the -o should be indented with spaces to show 

it is a follow-on from the previous line).
