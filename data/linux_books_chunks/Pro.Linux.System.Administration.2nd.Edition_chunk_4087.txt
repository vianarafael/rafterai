It is simple to set up, and you can place it anywhere on the network.

 ■ Note  We will look at setting up Bareos’s console in the “Introducing the Bareos Web-uI” section.

The Bareos server requires the following TCP ports open on your server:

•	

•	

•	

The Bareos Director daemon requires port 9101 (on the Bareos server only).

The Bareos Storage daemon requires port 9102 (on the Bareos server only).

The Bareos File daemon requires port 9103 (on any target host or client).

You add them with the following command on the backup server:

$ sudo firewall-cmd --zone public --permanent --add-service bacula
$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload

On the clients, you only need to open TCP port 9103, and on CentOS hosts you will find that there is a 

bacula-client service provided in firewalld.

$ sudo firewall-cmd --zone public --permanent --add-service bacula-client
$ sudo firewall-cmd –reload

If you are running this on Ubuntu, you can use ufw to add the application file (/etc/ufw/

applications.d/bareos) like so:

[Bareos]
title=Bareos Backup Server
description=The Bareos Backup Server.
ports=9101,9102,9103/tcp

And you do similar for the client by just allowing port 9103 access.
