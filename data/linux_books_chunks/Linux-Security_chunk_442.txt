DAC or MAC

Standard Unix permissions use Discretionary Access Control to set permissions on files.
This means that a user that owns a file, can make it world readable by typing chmod 777
$file.

With selinux the kernel will enforce Mandatory Access Control which strictly controls
what processes or threads can do with files (superseding DAC).
