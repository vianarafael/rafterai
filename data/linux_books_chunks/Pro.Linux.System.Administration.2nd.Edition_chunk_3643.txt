This is because Samba is going to manage this subdomain, which would 
conflict with our example.com domain. We are also setting up only one domain controller and having that 
act as our file server. The Samba documentation recommends that this setup is not suitable for production 
use, but instead we should have one or two Samba AD and a couple of file servers that hang off the ADs.
