Search domains are again DNS settings that 
allow you to append a domain name to your DNS search queries. For example, when you query for the IP 
address of au-mel-centos-2, your networking layer will know to add the domain au-mel-centos-2.example.
com to the query for you. Again you can have multiple domains here separated by commas or you can leave 
this blank.
