In Fedora, 
even your basic Fedora repositories are enabled from .repo ﬁ les in this directory.

Here’s an example of a simple yum conﬁ guration ﬁ le named /etc/yum.repos.d/
myrepo.repo:

[myrepo]
name=My repository of software packages
baseurl=http://myrepo.example.com/pub/myrepo
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/MYOWNKEY

Each repository entry begins with the name of the repository enclosed in square brackets.
