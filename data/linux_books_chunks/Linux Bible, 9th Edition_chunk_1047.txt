The VSZ and RSS sizes may be 
 different because VSZ is the amount of memory allocated for the process, whereas RSS 
is the amount that is actually being used. RSS memory represents physical memory that 
cannot be swapped.

START shows the time the process began running, and TIME shows the cumulative 
 system time used.
