As 
your web browser requests a page from such an application, the web server processes the code in the page 
and displays the output to your browser. To be able to host these web applications, the web server needs to 
be able to understand and execute PHP code.

Executing PHP can be done two ways. You can add PHP support to Apache by installing a module and 
using the prefork Apache MPM.
