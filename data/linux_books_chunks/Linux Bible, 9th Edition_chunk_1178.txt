Unless you tell it otherwise with declare, your 
variables are just a bunch of letters to bash. But when you start trying to do arithmetic 
with them, bash converts them to integers if it can. This makes it possible to do some fairly 
complex arithmetic in bash.

Integer arithmetic can be performed using the built-in let command or through the 
 external expr or bc commands.
