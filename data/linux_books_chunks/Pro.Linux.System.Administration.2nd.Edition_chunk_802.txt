this means that even when you use the adduser 
command, the default useradd options you configure in /etc/default/useradd are still honored.

You can also use the adduser script to quickly add a user to a group, by running this:

$ sudo adduser username groupname

Both the user and group need to already exist on the host.

the adduser and addgroup scripts themselves can also be configured via the /etc/adduser.conf file.
