Move to the end of the command using the arrow keys and delete the extra i, leaving you with

$ whoami

Now press the Enter key, and you will see the result on the command line:

jsmith

This time the corrected command, whoami, has again returned the name of the user who is logged in.

 another useful Bash feature is autocompletion.
