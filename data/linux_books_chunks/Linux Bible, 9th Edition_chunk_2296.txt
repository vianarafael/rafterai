If you are using the Fedora or RHEL distribution, for example, the client and server 
software packages that contain the ssh tools are openssh, openssh-clients, and 
openssh-server packages, as follows:

# yum list installed | grep ssh
...
openssh.x86_64                  6.4p1-5.fc20        @updates
openssh-clients.x86_64          6.4p1-5.fc20        @updates
openssh-server.x86_64           6.4p1-5.fc20        @updates

On Ubuntu, only the openssh-clients package is installed.
