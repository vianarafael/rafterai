If that doesn’t work, try one 
of the DNS servers listed in the resolv.conf ﬁ le you just copied to your home 
directory.

Or, if you are using the network service, edit the /etc/resolv.conf ﬁ le directly, 
so the ﬁ le includes at least the following line:

nameserver 8.8.8.8

In either case, use the dig command to check that the DNS server was able to 
resolve an address:

# dig google.com
...
google.com.
