NAts ability to hide our ‘private’ network address space 
means that many hosts and devices don’t have to worry about network attacks (well, they should, but 
they don’t).

when we consider that every iPv6 device is reachable from the internet and we consider the default 
rules for the firewall chains we have just shown, our systems could be in for a wild time without the 
security fig leaf of NAt’ing.
