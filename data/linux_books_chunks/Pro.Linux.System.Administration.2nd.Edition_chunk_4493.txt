The â€“H argument is the URI we want to attach to, ldapi:///, which is saying, connect to local LDAP 
server via the Unix socket on the local host. With this we can pass the UID and GID of the user to the LDAP 
server for authentication. Next, -b defines the search base; we are searching in the cn=config DIT for each 
dn (or distinguished name) by using dn as a filter.
