In determining whether a product 
is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular 
product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of 
that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which 
the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.
