Both commands are shown in the code that follows:

# getenforce
Enforcing
# sestatus
SELinux status:                 enabled
SELinuxfs mount:                /sys/fs/selinux
SELinux root directory:         /etc/selinux
Loaded policy name:             targeted
Current mode:                   enforcing
Mode from config file:          enforcing
Policy MLS status:              enabled
Policy deny_unknown status:     allowed
Max kernel policy version:      28

To change the mode setting, you can use the setenforce newsetting, where 
newsetting is either:

 ■ enforcing or 1

 ■ permissive or 0

Notice that you cannot use the setenforce command to change SELinux to disabled mode.

The example that follows shows the SELinux mode being changed immediately to permis-
sive mode via the setenforce command.
