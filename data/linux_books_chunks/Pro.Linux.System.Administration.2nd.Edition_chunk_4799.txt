You don’t have to provide the password as clear text; if it makes you uncomfortable, you can 
try these other methods as well:

•	

https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_authnz_ldap.html#authldapbind
password

Finally, we specify that we require a valid user, and the authenticating user must also belong to the 

LDAP group cn=admin,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com.

 To find out more on LDAP and Apache authentication, read the following: https://httpd.apache.

 ■ Note 
org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_authnz_ldap.html.

Before we proceed, we will need to make sure that the modules are added to our web host, and on 

Ubuntu we would do the following:

$ sudo a2enmod authnz_ldap
$ sudo a2enmod ldap
$ sudo a2enmod ssl

For CentOS, we need to make sure that the packages mod_ssl and mod_ldap are installed; this will create 

the file in the conf.modules.d directory.

$ cat /etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/01-ldap.conf
# This file configures the LDAP modules:
LoadModule ldap_module modules/mod_ldap.so
LoadModule authnz_ldap_module modules/mod_authnz_ldap.so

We need to now restart our Apache service (restart apache2 for Ubuntu).

$ sudo systemctl restart httpd

We use our web browser now to connect to the LAM web GUI at the following address: https://ldap.

example.com/lam.

In Figure 16-13, you can see the authentication challenge provided by Apache.
