Check the memory requirements for the operating 
systems and applications you plan to run to better determine your memory needs.

To check the number and types of processors on your computer, type the following:

# grep processor /proc/cpuinfo
processor : 0
...
processor : 6
processor : 7
# head /proc/cpuinfo
processor  : 0
vendor_id  : GenuineIntel
cpu family : 6
model      : 60
model name : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4800MQ CPU @ 2.70GHz
stepping   : 3
cpu MHz    : 2701.000
cache size : 6144 KB
...

The Ô¨Å rst command in the preceding code shows that there are eight (0 through 7) 
 processors on the computer.
