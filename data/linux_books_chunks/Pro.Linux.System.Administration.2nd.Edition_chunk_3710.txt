We are shortly going to 
create our Samba users and groups via the samba-tool command, and once that is done, we will create our 
directories and assign permissions.

We have set up Samba in such a way that requires user accounts to be administered on the Samba host. 

Samba provides a subcommand to samba-tool to administer user accounts on your Samba host.
