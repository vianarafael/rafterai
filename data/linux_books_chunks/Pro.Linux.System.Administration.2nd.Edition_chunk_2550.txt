Comments in these configuration files are 
prefixed with a double slash (//) and all directives and blocks are terminated with a semicolon (;).

The include directive tells named to read the specified file and process any directives it contains, 

including nested include commands. In this case, the named.conf.options file contains the options section, 
which affects the way named operates.
