There are content delivery networks (CDNs) 

services such as Akamai, Cloudflare, CloudFront, and Fastly as well as software such as Varnish, Nginx, 
Apache, and Squid-Cache.

Web caching works by using HTTP headers. The Cache-Control and ETag headers are used by the 
browser to determine when the resource it is requesting has changed and should be fetched again.
