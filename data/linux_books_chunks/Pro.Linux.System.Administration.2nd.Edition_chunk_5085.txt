With this protocol it 

is possible to send your log data across a network to a remote system where another rsyslog daemon can 
collect and centralize your logs.

 â–  Tip 

 rsyslog traffic is usually transmitted via tCp on port 514.

Configuring rsyslog
The rsyslog daemon is controlled by a configuration file located in /etc called rsyslog.conf.
