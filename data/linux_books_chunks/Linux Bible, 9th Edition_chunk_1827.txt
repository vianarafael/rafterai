By adding a -p 
to those query options, you can query an RPM ﬁ le sitting in your local directory instead. 
The -p option is a great way to look inside a package that someone gives you to investigate 
what it is before you install it on your system.

If you haven’t already, get the zsh package and put it in your local directory (yumdown-
loader zsh).
