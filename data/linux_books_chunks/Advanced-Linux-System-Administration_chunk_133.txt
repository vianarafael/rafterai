Custom Boot Disk 1:

All we need is a floppy with a Linux kernel image that can boot, and this image must be 
told were to find the root device on the hard drive.

Assuming that we are using a pre-formatted DOS floppy, the following creates a bootable 
floppy which will launch a linux kernel image

dd if=/boot/vmlinuz of=/dev/fd0

Next,  rdev is used to tell the kernel where the root device is.
