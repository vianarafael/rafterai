The 
find command will then search the specified location and return a list of files that match the search criteria.
You could also use the find command to locate files and directories that aren’t owned by any user 

or group. These often exist if a user or group has been deleted and the associated files not reassigned 
or removed with that user or group. We’ll talk more about this in Chapter 6.
