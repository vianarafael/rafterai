To do that we add our 
enp0s9 interface to the zone=dmz as we did for enp0s8.

Once we have that our dmz zone should look like this:

CHAPter 7 ■ NetworkiNg AND FirewAllS

$msudo firewall-cmd --zone=dmz --list-all
dmz (active)
 interfaces: enp0s9
 sources:
 services: ssh
 ports:
 masquerade: no
 forward-ports:
 icmp-blocks:
 rich rules:

Now when we try to access our site from the public internet, with something like curl:

$ curl -I http://website.example.com
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
