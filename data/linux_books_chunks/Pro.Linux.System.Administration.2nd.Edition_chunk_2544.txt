After the DNS type (SOA) you will see seven fields.

<name server>    <admin email address>      serial #     refresh   retry  expiry   nx ttl
ns2.google.com.   dns-admin.google.com.    125880391         900    900     1800       60

We will look at them in greater detail shortly but we would like to mention the last item in the list, which 
is the negative cache TTL, or nx ttl.
