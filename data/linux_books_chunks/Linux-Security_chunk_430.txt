Since kernel version 2.6 it is an
integrated part of Linux.

SELinux offers security! SELinux can control what kind of access users have to files and
processes. Even when a file received chmod 777, SELinux can still prevent applications
from accessing it (Unix file permissions are checked first!). SELinux does this by placing
users in roles that represent a security context.
