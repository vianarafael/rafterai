There 
is a plug-in called write_graphite, which will send Collectd metrics to a Graphite carbon-cache or relay.

The configuration is simple and looks like the following:

LoadPlugin write_graphite

<Plugin write_graphite>
  <Node "monitor">
    Host "relay.example.com"
    Port "2013"
    Protocol "tcp"
    ReconnectInterval 0
    LogSendErrors true
    Prefix "collectd_"
    StoreRates true
    AlwaysAppendDS false
    EscapeCharacter "_"
  </Node>
</Plugin>

This is the same plug-in format we saw earlier.
