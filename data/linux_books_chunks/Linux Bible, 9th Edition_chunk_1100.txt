You decide you want 
to kill it so that other processes have a shot at the CPU. If you use the process ID of the 
running bigcommand process, here are some examples of the kill command you can use 
to kill that process:

$ kill 10432
$ kill -15 10432
$ kill -SIGKILL 10432

The default signal sent by kill is 15 (SIGTERM), so the Ô¨Å rst two examples have exactly the 
same results.
