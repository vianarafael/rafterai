# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

Configuring network cards for dhcp is good practice for clients, but servers usually require
a fixed ip address.

fixed ip

The screenshot below shows /etc/network/interfaces configured with a fixed ip address.

root@debian7~# cat /etc/network/interfaces
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto  eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address   10.42.189.198
broadcast 10.42.189.207
netmask   255.255.255.240
gateway   10.42.189.193

The  screenshot  above  also  shows  that  you  can  provide  more  configuration  than  just  the
ip address.
