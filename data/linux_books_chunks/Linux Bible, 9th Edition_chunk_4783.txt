However, all the iptables utility commands are still 
valid for Ubuntu:

 ■ To enable the ﬁ rewall, type sudo ufw enable at the command line.

 ■ To disable the ﬁ rewall, type sudo ufw disable at the command line.

Thankfully, after you have checked the status and enabled or disabled the netfilter/
iptables ﬁ rewall, the differences between the distributions end.

To see what policies and rules are currently in place for the filter table, type iptables 
-t filter -vnL at the command line.
