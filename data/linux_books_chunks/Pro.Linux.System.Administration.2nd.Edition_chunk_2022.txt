We pass the –x to tell tar to extract the archive. The –f is used to provide the file to work on.

$ tar -xvzf nginx-1.10.1.tar.gz

 ■ Tip 
If you don’t know what compression a tarball uses, you can find out by using the file command. run 
file <tarball> and file will check the tarball for magic bytes, which indicate the file type.
