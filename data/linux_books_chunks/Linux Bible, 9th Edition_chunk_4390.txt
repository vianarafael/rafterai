A control ﬂ ag is either of the following:

 ■ Simple keyword—The only concern here is if the corresponding PAM module 
returns a response of either “failed” or “success.” See Table 23.4 for how these 
 statuses are handled.

 ■ Series of actions—The returned module status is handled through the series of 

actions listed in the ﬁ le.

Table 23.4 shows the various keyword control ﬂ ags and their responses to the returned 
module status.
