In this case, the last few lines looked like this:

# smbclient -L localhost
    ...
    Server         Comment
    ---------      -------
    FEDORA21       Samba Server Version 4.1.15
    Workgroup      Master
    ---------      -------
    MYGROUP        FEDORA21

You can see that the new NetBIOS serverâ€™s name is FEDORA21 and that it is the master 
server for the workgroup.
