You can see from Listing 16-6 that the file is made up of four independent management groups: auth, 
account, password, and session.

Take a look at the following line, which is an example of the auth management group:

auth        sufficient    pam_sss.so use_first_pass

This group authenticates the user usually by some password challenge-response mechanism.
