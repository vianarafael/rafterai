After your system comes up, with the broken 
 services not started, you can go back and try to debug those individual services.

One last comment about startup scripts: The /etc/rc.local Ô¨Å le is one of the last 
 services to run at each runlevel. As an example, in runlevel 5, it is linked to /etc/rc5.d/
S99local.
