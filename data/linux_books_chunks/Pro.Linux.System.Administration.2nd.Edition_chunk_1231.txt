Let’s take a look at our last line again:

42 4 1 * 3 root run-parts /etc/cron.monthly

Here we’ve changed the value in the day of the week column to 3. Our job would now run at 04:42 a.m. 

on the first day of the month and also every Wednesday.

 day of the week starts with Sunday at 0 and goes through to Saturday at 6.
