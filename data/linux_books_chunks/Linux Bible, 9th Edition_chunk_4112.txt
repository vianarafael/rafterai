Thus, using the -M option, the maximum number of days is set before the password 
expires and the setting for the password inactivity time should take hold.

# chage -M 30 -I 5 tim
# chage -l tim | grep Password
Password expires                 : Mar 03, 2017
Password inactive                : Mar 08, 2017

Now, timâ€™s account will be locked 5 days after his password expires.
