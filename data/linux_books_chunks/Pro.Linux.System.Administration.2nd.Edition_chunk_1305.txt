This 

does not currently have an IP address associated with it:

  $ ip addr show
3: enp0s8: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 08:00:27:13:3c:00 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

Comparing it to our previous output you can immediately notice that the state is DOWN and that we can 
only see a MAC address that has been assigned to the network device enp0s8.
