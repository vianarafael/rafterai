For example, 
if Nagios was monitoring our gateway.example.com host and a check of this host failed, a notification much 
like this would be generated:

***** Nagios *****

Notification Type: PROBLEM
Host: gateway.example.com
State: DOWN

Address: 192.168.0.254
Info: PING CRITICAL - Packet loss = 100%

Date/Time: Fri Feb 13 00:30:28 EST 2009

 nagios can issue alerts through more than just e-mail.
