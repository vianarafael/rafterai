Changing Permissions

# chmod u+x myfile
# chmod u-x,og+w myfile
# chmod 654 myfile

In Listing 4-11, we’ve changed the myfile file’s permissions three times. Permission changes are 

performed by specifying the class, the action you want to perform, the permission itself, and then the file you 
want to change. In our first example, you can see u+x.
