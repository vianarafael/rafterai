You will need to download and install the iptables-
services package (yum install â€“y iptables-services) to get access to the following commands.

To start and stop iptables you can use the systemctl command:

$ sudo systemctl start|stop|restart iptables

These actions should be self-explanatory by now. You can also use status to the current status as you 

would expect.
