Another setting in the ifcfg-eth0 example keeps 
regular users from being able to start and stop the interface (USERCTL=no).

Here’s what an ifcfg-eth1 ﬁ le might look like for a wired Ethernet interface that uses 
static IP addresses:

DEVICE=eth1
HWADDR=00:1B:21:0A:E8:5E
TYPE=Ethernet
BOOTPROTO=none
ONBOOT=yes
USERCTL=no
IPADDR=192.168.0.140
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=192.168.0.1

In this ifcfg-eth1 example, because this is setting address and other information 
 statically, BOOTPROTO is set to none.
