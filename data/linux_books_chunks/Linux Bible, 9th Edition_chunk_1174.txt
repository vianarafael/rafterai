In the next 
two lines, the THIS and THAT variables are set to their current values or to Not Set, if 
they are not currently set. Notice that because I just set THIS to the string Example, when 
I echo the value of THIS it appears as Example. However, because THAT was not set, it 
appears as Not Set.

For the rest of this section, I show how variables and commands may appear in a shell script.
