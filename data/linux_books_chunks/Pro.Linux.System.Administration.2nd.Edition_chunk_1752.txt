Checking DSL connection

Once you have created a PPPoE device on Ubuntu, you will see that the ppp section has been added to /

etc/network/interfaces file:

auto dsl-provider
iface dsl-provider inet ppp
pre-up /bin/ip link set enp0s8 up # line maintained by pppoeconf
provider dsl-provider

Here you can see that an interface called dsl-provider is going to be created when the network is started, 

signified by auto dsl-provider.
