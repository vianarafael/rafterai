It can also keep large remotely mounted 
fi lesystems from being searched.

Here’s another example, except that instead of looking for a user’s ﬁ les, we’re looking for 
ﬁ les larger than 100 kilobytes (-size +100M):

# find / -xdev -size +100M | xargs ls -ldS > /tmp/size

You can save yourself lots of disk space by just removing some of the largest ﬁ les that are 
no longer needed.
