Using Vagrant is a great way 

to explore and learn Linux without the need to install a physical server, and it runs inside the VirtualBox 
virtualization environment.

Logging In
After your Linux host or LiveCD boots, you will be presented with a login prompt: either a command-line or 
GUI (graphical user interface) login prompt.

In Figure 4-1, you can see a typical command-line login prompt for an Ubuntu Linux host, and in 

Figure 4-2, you can see the graphical login for a CentOS host.

 Don’t panic if your initial screens differ slightly from these, as some minor changes do appear 

 ■ Note 
between versions.
