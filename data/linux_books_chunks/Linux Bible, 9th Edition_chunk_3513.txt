The global cups options = raw setting makes all printers raw printers (meaning that 
the Windows client needs to provide the proper printer driver for each shared printer).

Here’s what the default printers section looks like in the smb.conf ﬁ le:

[printers]
        comment = All Printers
        path = /var/spool/samba
        browseable = no
;       guest ok = no
;       writable = No
        printable = yes

The printable = yes line causes all your CUPS printers on the local system to be 
shared by Samba.
