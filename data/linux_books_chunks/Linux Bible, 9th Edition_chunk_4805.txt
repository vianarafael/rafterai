After that, a speciﬁ c rule must be appended to block network packets from 
Host-B’s IP address, 10.140.67.22, alone.

# iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
# iptables -A INPUT -s 10.140.67.22 -j DROP
# iptables -vnL
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
DROP       all  --  10.140.67.22             anywhere
Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Host-C can now successfully ping and ssh into Host-A, meeting one of the set goals.

$ ping -c 2 10.140.67.23

However, Host-B can neither ping nor ssh into Host-A.
