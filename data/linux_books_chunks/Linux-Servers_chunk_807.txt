Processes are confined by
the kernel to the minimum access they require.

SELinux MAC is about labeling and type enforcing! Files, processes, etc are all labeled with
an SELinux context. For files, these are extended attributes, for processes this is managed
by the kernel.

The format of the labels is as follows:

user:role:type:(level)

We only use the type label in the targeted policy.
