Clients that connect to our LDAP server will 
need to have the CA root certificate installed.

First, create a new directory called /etc/ldap/certs and then change the permissions on it.

$ sudo mkdir /etc/ldap/certs

We will create the key and the CSR on our ldap.example.com host and run the following from inside the 

/etc/ldap/certs directory:

$ sudo openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout ïƒ‰
ldap.example.com.key -out ldap.example.com.req

Go ahead and sign the request like we did in Chapters 11 and 15 by our private CA.
