We could also use the traditional 

shebang (#!/bin/bash) to let Linux know we are running a Bash script.

Lines 2–5 are comments describing our script. Lines 6–7 set RSYNC variables, and lines 10–13 declare the 
list of hosts we want to sync from. Lines 15–19 are more variables. The backup directory we will be directing 
our backups to is BACKUP_DIR='/data/backups'.
