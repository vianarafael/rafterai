With the classiﬁ cation set to topsecret, you can have 
Top Secret displayed on all pages that go through the print server:

Classification topsecret

Other classiﬁ cations you can substitute for topsecret include classified, 
 confidential, secret, and unclassified.

The ServerCertificate and ServerKey lines (not set by default) can be set up to 
 indicate where the certiﬁ cate and key are stored, respectively:

ServerCertificate /etc/cups/ssl/server.crt
ServerKey /etc/cups/ssl/server.key

Activate these two lines if you want to do encrypted connections.
