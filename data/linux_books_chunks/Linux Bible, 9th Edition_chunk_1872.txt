After opening a Terminal window with root permission, you simply invoke 
 useradd at the command prompt, with details of the new account as parameters.

The only required parameter is the login name of the user, but you probably want to include 
some additional information ahead of it. Each item of account information is preceded by 
a single-letter option code with a dash in front of it.
