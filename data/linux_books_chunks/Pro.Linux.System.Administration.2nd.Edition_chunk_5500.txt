Inside this file, find this 
line:

disable = yes

and change it to this:

disable = no

Next, you enable the TFTP server like so:

$ sudo systemctl enable tftp
$ sudo systemctl start tftp

You need to ensure your hosts can connect to the Cobbler server through your firewall by opening some 

required ports, 69, 80, 25150, and 25151, for example, by creating firewalld rules such as the following:

$ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=tftp --permanent
$ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=httpd –permanent
$ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=25150:25151/tcp –permanent

These rules allow access for any host on the 192.168.0.0/24 subnet to the boot server on the appropriate 

ports.
