Click 
in the Workspaces pane to change names of workspaces to any names you choose.

You can view and change information about Metacity controls and settings using the 
gconf-editor window (type gconf-editor from a Terminal window). As the window 
says, it is not the recommended way to change preferences, so when possible, you should 
change the desktop through GNOME 2 preferences.
