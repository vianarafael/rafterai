There are ﬁ ve chains (categories) that a network packet can be designated as, 
as follows:

 ■ INPUT—Network packets coming into the Linux server

 ■ FORWARD—Network packets coming into the Linux server that are to be routed 

elsewhere

 ■ OUTPUT—Network packets coming out of the Linux server

 ■ PREROUTING—Used by NAT, for modifying network packets when they come into 

the Linux server

 ■ POSTROUTING—Used by NAT, for modifying network packets before they come out 

of the Linux server

Which netfilter/iptables table you choose to work with determine what chains are 
available for categorizing network packets.
