Chapter 15 ■ NetworkiNg with VpNs

To force all traffic up the VPN tunnel from the client, we add the following directive to the mobile.conf 

configuration file on our gateway host:

push "redirect-gateway def1"

If your VPN setup is over a wireless network and all clients and the server are on the same wireless 

network, you need to add to this directive.

push "redirect-gateway local def1"

You can see we’ve added the local option to the directive.

firewalls, and OpenVPN itself.
