If the httpd process had a PID of 
1833, you could use either of these commands to have it read conﬁ guration ﬁ les again:

# kill -1 1833
# systemctl reload httpd

Using killall to signal processes by name
With the killall command, you can signal processes by name instead of by process ID. 
The advantage is that you don’t have to look up the process ID of the process you want to 
kill.
