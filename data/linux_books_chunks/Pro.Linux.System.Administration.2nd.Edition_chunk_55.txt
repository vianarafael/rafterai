The ubuntu project guarantees that an LTS release will be supported (e.g., bugs fixed 
and security issues patched) for a period of five years after its release. Red hat also has a similar release cycle 
where Red hat tries to maintain binary compatibility for the life of the release (meaning it doesnâ€™t change major 
packages for life of the release).
