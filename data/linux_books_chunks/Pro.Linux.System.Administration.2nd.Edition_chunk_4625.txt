In Listing 16-3 we see we are using 

the LDIF format to add these access lists. Letâ€™s take the first section and explain it.

dn: olcDatabase={1}mdb,cn=config
changetype: modify
replace: olcAccess
olcAccess: {0}<access list>
-
add: olcAccess
olcAccess: {1}<access list>

The first line is the DN, the main config database in this case, we want to work on.
