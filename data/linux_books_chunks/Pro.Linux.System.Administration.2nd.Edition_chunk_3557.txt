On Ubuntu we will create the required OpenDKIM directories with the following:

$ sudo mkdir –p /etc/opendkim/keys && sudo touch /etc/opendkim/{KeyTable,SigningTable,Trust
edHosts}
$ sudo mkdir –p /var/spool/opendkim
$ sudo chown opendkim:opendkim –R /etc/opendkim/* /var/spool/opendkim && sudo chmod 0640 /
etc/opendkim/*
$ sudo chmod 0750 /etc/opendkim/keys
