The –p option tells netstat to display what applications are using each connection, and 
the last option, –t, tells netstat to look for TCP connections only. 

The netstat command displays the programs listening on certain ports on your host. We can see in the 
preceding output that the program nc, PID of 18618, is listening for TCP connections on port 80.
