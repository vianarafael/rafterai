An example of a network 
 ﬁ rewall is in your workplace, where the network should be protected by a 
screening router’s ﬁ rewall.

A host-based ﬁ rewall is one that is running on and protecting an individual host 
or server. You most likely have a ﬁ rewall on your PC at home. This is a host-based 
ﬁ rewall. Another example of a host-based ﬁ rewall is the firestarter application.
