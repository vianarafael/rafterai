First we can 
run a test on syntax of the file with the following:

$ sudo iptables-restore â€“t -v < /path/to/your/iptables.bak
Flushing chain `INPUT'
Flushing chain `FORWARD'
Flushing chain `OUTPUT'
# Completed on Fri May 20 21:49:49 2016

This show a verbose output (-v) of the command and will give an error if there is something wrong in 
your config file (like iptables-restore: line 4 failed).
