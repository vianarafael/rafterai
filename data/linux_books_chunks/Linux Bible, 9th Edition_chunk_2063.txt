Notice that there is a mixture of 
Linux and swap partitions in both examples and Linux LVM partitions in the 
ﬁ rst example.

Your ﬁ rst primary hard disk usually appears as /dev/sda. With RHEL and Fedora installa-
tions, there is usually at least one LVM partition created by the installer, out of which other 
partitions can be assigned.
