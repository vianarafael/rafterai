This directive allows you to 
specify a port number or an address and port number combination.

If you want Squid to listen on multiple addresses and ports, you can add more http_port directives.
Because we’re setting up Squid on the gateway host, we don’t want it to listen for connections on all 
interfaces; users not on our local networks should not be able to access it.
