You might do this, in particular, if the swap area is no longer needed and you want to reclaim 
the space being consumed by a swap Ô¨Å le or remove a USB drive that is providing a swap 
partition.

First, make sure that no space is being used on the swap device (using the free command), 
and then use swapoff to turn off the swap area so you can reuse the space.
