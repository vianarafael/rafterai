For a new server administrator, this means that if there are graphical administration tools 
installed on a server, you can run those tools without having to sit at the console. For example:

$ ssh -X johndoe@10.140.67.23 system-config-date
johndoe@10.140.67.23's password: **********

After running this command, you are prompted for the root password.
