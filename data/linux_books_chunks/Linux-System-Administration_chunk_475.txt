example: using lvm

This example shows how you can use a device (in this case /dev/sdc, but it could have been /
dev/sdb or any other disk or partition) with lvm, how to create a volume group (vg) and how
to create and use a logical volume (vg/lvol0).

First thing to do, is create physical volumes that can join the volume group with pvcreate.
This command makes a disk or partition available for use in Volume Groups.
