For example, here’s how to repeat the date command shown as 
command number 382 in the preceding history listing:

$ !382
dateWed Oct 29 21:30:06 PDT 2014

 ■ !!—Run previous command. Runs the previous command line. Here’s how you 

would immediately run that same date command:

$ !!
dateWed Oct 29 21:30:39 PDT 2014

 ■ !?string?—Run command containing string.
