These values 

mean the server will use a bit more RAM, but it will need to access the disk less often, resulting in better 
performance. We tell the server it has two transaction log files via innodb_log_files_in_group, which is the 
default.

Next, we need to assign some RAM for the server to use to keep table data and perform queries.
