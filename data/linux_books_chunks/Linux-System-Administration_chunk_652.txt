installing grub

Run  the  grub-install  command  to  install  grub.  The  command  requires  a  destination  for
overwriting the boot sector or mbr.

# grub-install /dev/hda

You will rarely have to do this manually, since grub is installed when installing the operating
system and does not need any re-install when changing configuration (as is the case for lilo).
