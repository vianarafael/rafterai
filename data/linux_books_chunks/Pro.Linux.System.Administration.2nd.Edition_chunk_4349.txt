On CentOS we would be using the /etc/pki/tls 
directory again.

[branch1]$ sudo mv branch1.example.com.cert /etc/ssl/certs/
[branch1]$ sudo mv branch1.example.com.key /etc/ssl/private/
[branch1]$ sudo mv cacert.pem /etc/ssl/certs/

We want to protect our certificate and key with the right ownership and some restricted permissions for 

our key.

branch1$ sudo chown root:root /etc/ssl{certs,private}/branch1.example.com.*
branch1$ sudo chown root:root /etc/ssl/certs/cacert.pem
branch1$ sudo chmod 0400 /etc/ssl/private/gateway.example.com.key
