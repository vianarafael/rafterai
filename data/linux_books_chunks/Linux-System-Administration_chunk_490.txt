Three physical disks because lvm uses two disks for the mirror and a third
disk for the mirror log!

[root@RHEL5 ~]# pvcreate /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd
  Physical volume "/dev/sdb" successfully created
  Physical volume "/dev/sdc" successfully created
  Physical volume "/dev/sdd" successfully created
[root@RHEL5 ~]# pvs
  PV         VG         Fmt  Attr PSize   PFree  
  /dev/sdb              lvm2 --   409.60M 409.60M
  /dev/sdc              lvm2 --   409.60M 409.60M
  /dev/sdd              lvm2 --   409.60M 409.60M

Then we create the Volume Group and verify again with pvs.
