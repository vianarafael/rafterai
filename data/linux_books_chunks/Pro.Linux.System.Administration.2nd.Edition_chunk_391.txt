The name of the VM will be in the form of directory_box name_random 
numbers. You will be able to view this in your VirtualBox console (and change the settings just like any other 
VirtualBox). We can see the network is being set up including the ports we will use for SSH (22 => 2222). 
There is automatic port collision detection so instead of using port 2222, Vagrant chooses port 2203.
