Once we start it, we 
can unlock one or more private keys and add them to the agent. SSH can then use the agent to provide a 
private key and authenticate us to a remote host.

The way to tell SSH about the agent is by setting two environment variables, SSH_AUTH_SOCK and SSH_
AGENT_PID. If these are set, ssh can communicate with the agent.
