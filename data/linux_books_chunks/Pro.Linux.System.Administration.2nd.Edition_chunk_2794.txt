We can log in to the au-mel-centos-1 host and 
see the file data.txt is now in the /tmp directory.

We can also copy from a remote host back to a local host, by specifying a remote file path as the first 

parameter and a local file or directory second.

$ scp jsmith@au-mel-centos-1:/tmp/data.txt /tmp
data.txt                                      100% 3072KB    3.0MB/s    00:00

We can even copy files or directories from one remote host to another remote host without logging in to 

either of them.
