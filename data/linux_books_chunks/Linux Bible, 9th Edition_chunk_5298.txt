To list out services running (or active) on your server, you need to use different 

commands, depending upon the initialization daemon you are using.

 ■ For SysVinit, use the service command as shown in this example:

# service --status-all | grep running... | sort
anacron (pid 2162) is running...
atd (pid 2172) is running...
...

 ■ For Upstart, use the initctl command.
