You can restrict which systems can use 
your proxy server (by hostname or IP address) and even limit which sites they can visit 
(by  speciﬁ c address, range of addresses, hostname, or domain names).

Conﬁ guring a squid proxy server can be as simple as installing the squid package, editing 
the /etc/squid/squid.conf ﬁ le, and starting the squid service.
