Running yum update every night makes it less 
likely that you will encounter major dependency problems than if you update your 
system only every few months. In Fedora, there is a yum-updatesd package that 
lets you do nightly checks for updates and then send e-mail to a user of your choice 
if updates are available. In RHEL, you could build a cron job to check for or run 
nightly updates.
