The dig command shows information similar to what appears in the Ô¨Å les 
that hold DNS records. The QUESTION section of the output shows that the address sec-
tion asked for the address of redhat.com and the ANSWER section showed the answer 
(209.132.183.181). You can also see the address of the DNS server that was queried.

The host and dig commands are only used to query DNS servers.
