Ansible provides a command called ansible-playbook, and it is 
designed to connect to particular hosts and run a series of tasks. Playbooks are quite powerful, they can 
run in serial or parallel across your hosts, and they can delegate tasks to other hosts and wait for those to 
complete before moving on to the next task.
