If we want to install version 4, we will have to install 
from source.

$ sudo apt-get install nagios3 nagios-plugins

This will install Nagios version 3 and all the required supporting packages including the Nagios plug-ins.
If you want to install from source (for either CentOS or Ubuntu, but this is for Ubuntu), you need to do 

the following.

First we need to create users and groups to run and manage the Nagios service.

$ sudo useradd nagios  && \
sudo groupadd nagcmd && \
sudo usermod -aG nagcmd www-data && \
sudo usermod â€“aG nagcmd nagios

We have added the nagcmd group to the www-data and nagios users so that the web service can read the 

Nagios results.
