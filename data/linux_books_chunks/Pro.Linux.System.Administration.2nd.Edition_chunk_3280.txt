Be careful to avoid folder names containing spaces, like 
“My personal Mail,” as sometimes your mail client can get confused. You should use an underscore or dash to 
link the words together like so: “My-personal_Mail.”

On Ubuntu, there is another, potentially easier, way to create your Maildir directories and folders.
