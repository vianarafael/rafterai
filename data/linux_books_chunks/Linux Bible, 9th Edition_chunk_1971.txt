To implant the acl mount option and check that it is there, I ran the following commands:

# tune2fs -o acl /dev/sdc1
# tune2fs -l /dev/sdc1 | grep "mount options"
Default mount options:    acl

You can test that this worked by remounting the ﬁ lesystem and trying to use the setfacl 
command on a ﬁ le in that ﬁ lesystem.

A second way to add acl support to a ﬁ lesystem is to add the acl option to the line in the 
/etc/fstab ﬁ le that automatically mounts the ﬁ lesystem at boot time.
