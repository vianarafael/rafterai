A locate command ﬁ nds ﬁ les faster because it searches 
a database instead of having to search the whole ﬁ lesystem live. A disadvantage 
is that the locate command cannot ﬁ nd any ﬁ les added to the system since the 
previous time the database was created. Not every ﬁ le in your ﬁ lesystem is stored 
in the database.
