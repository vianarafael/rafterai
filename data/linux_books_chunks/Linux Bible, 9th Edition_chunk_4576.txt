The following is the message you receive when a system is going through a rela-
beling process after a reboot:

*** Warning -- SELinux targeted policy relabel is required.
*** Relabeling could take a very long time, depending on file
*** system size and speed of hard drives.

To modify the mode in the /etc/selinux/config ﬁ le, change the line SELINUX= to one 
of the following:

24

 ■ disabled

 ■ enforcing

 ■ permissive

The SELinux conﬁ guration ﬁ le example that follows shows that the mode has been set to 
permissive.
