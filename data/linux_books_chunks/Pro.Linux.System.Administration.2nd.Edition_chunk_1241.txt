Let’s look at an example created 
by the user jsmith using the –l, or list, option for crontab.

$ crontab -l
*/2 * * * * [ -e /tmp/log ] && rm -f /tmp/log

You will see a list of all the cron jobs scheduled by this user. This is a simple series of commands that 
first check for the existence of a file called /tmp/log, and if it exists, remove it.
