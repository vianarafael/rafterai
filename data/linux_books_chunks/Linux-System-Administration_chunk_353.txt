Chances are you will encounter this file system
also on your hard disk in the form of images of cdroms (often with the .iso extension). The
iso 9660 standard limits filenames to the 8.3 format. The Unix world didn't like this, and thus
added the rock ridge extensions, which allows for filenames up to 255 characters and Unix-
style file-modes, ownership and symbolic links.
