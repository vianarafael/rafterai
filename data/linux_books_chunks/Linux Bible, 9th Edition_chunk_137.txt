In my 
three years as a Linux instructor, I honed my teaching skills in front of live people whose Linux 
experience ranged from none to experienced professional.

In the previous edition, I turned my teaching experience into text to take a reader from someone 
who has never used Linux to someone with the skills to become a Linux professional.
