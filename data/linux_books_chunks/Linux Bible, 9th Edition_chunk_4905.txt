However, for 
our simple example, you can just edit the /etc/hosts ﬁ le on each system and add entries 
for each host.

Here is an example of what additional entries to your /etc/hosts ﬁ le might look like for 
the three systems used in this procedure:

192.168.0.138  host1.example.com host1
192.168.0.139  host2.example.com host2 
192.168.0.1    storage.example.com storage

Next you need to conﬁ gure the storage.

You can provide networked storage to the hypervisors for this procedure in many ways.
