By selecting Watermark (behind the text) or Overlay (over the 
text), you can set the other Watermark settings to determine how watermarks 
and overlays are done. Watermarks can go on every page (All) or only the ﬁ rst 
page (First Only). Select Watermark Text to choose what words are used for the 
watermark or overlay (Draft, Copy, Conﬁ dential, Final, and so on).
