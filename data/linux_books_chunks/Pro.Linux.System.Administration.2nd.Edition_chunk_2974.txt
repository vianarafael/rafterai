Inserts, updates, 

and deletes are recorded in them, and they can be replayed on a secondary server to keep them in 
sync. They can also be used by administrators to restore backups of databases. In the previous code, 
we tell the server to automatically purge binary logs after 14 days. This means we should do a backup 
of the MariaDB data at least every two weeks.
