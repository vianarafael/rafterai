By default on CentOS, the MariaDB server listens for 
connections on all configured network interfaces and addresses. Since we are going to have the web server 
and the database on the same host, we are going to limit the database to listen only on the loopback address. 
This is more secure, but in an ideal world we would have the database server and the web server on separate 
hosts.
