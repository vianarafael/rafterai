This 
tries the udf DVD filesystem first and then iso9660, which is used by CD-ROMs.

Mount options are passed as a comma-delimited list as well. In our example fstab, you can see two 

different options being used for the ext4 filesystems. The option, errors=remount-ro, controls what 
happens if a filesystem error occurs.
