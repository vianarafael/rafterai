For the first match we will give it the name audit_epoch, and for the second we will give it audit_counter. 
Now when we run our Logstash service again, we will see the following appear:

{
...
    "offset" => 5745528,
    "audit_epoch" => "1480846476.689",
   "audit_counter" => "1106",
...
}

We now have our audit log being successfully transformed and adding extra labels to our Logstash data.
