You can then 
dynamically create, resize, and delete volumes in a volume group, removing the need to unmount volumes 
or reboot the system to update the partition map.

The LVM system has three layers. The bottom layer consists of physical volumes: disks, partitions, or 
RAID arrays. Physical volumes are used to create volume groups. A volume group can consist of one or more 
physical volumes.
