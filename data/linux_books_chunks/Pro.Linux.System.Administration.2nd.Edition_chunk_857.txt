to do this, you need to edit the contents of the /etc/issue and /etc/
issue.net files. the issue file is displayed when you log in via the command line on the hostâ€™s console, and 
the issue.net file is displayed when you log in to the command line via an ssh session. Most distributions 
use these files for this purpose, including both Centos and Ubuntu.
