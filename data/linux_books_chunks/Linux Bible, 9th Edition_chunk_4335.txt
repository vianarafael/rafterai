Notice that the luks names are the 
same as those listed by the lvs command in the previous example.

# cat /etc/crypttab
luks-b099fbbe-0e56-425f-91a6-44f129db9f4b
     UUID=b099fbbe-0e56-425f-91a6-44f129db9f4b none

You can also use the cryptsetup command to help you uncover more information about 
your Linux systemâ€™s encrypted volumes.
