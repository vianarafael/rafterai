Next we are going to edit the ~/.duply/nightly/

exclude file to not back up certain files. The exclude file takes the following syntax:

- /path/to/exclude
+ /path/dir/of/directory/to/include
+ /path/*/**.py

We can use various conditions to select the paths that we want to include (+) or exclude (-). The file list 

is included unless it is specifically excluded.
