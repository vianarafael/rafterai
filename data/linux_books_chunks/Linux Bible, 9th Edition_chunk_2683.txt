For example, if you need 
to perform troubleshooting that requires the graphical interface to be down, you can type 
init 3 at the command line:

# init 3
INIT: Sending processes the TERM signal
starting irqbalance:                     [ OK ]
Starting setroubleshootd:
Starting fuse:  Fuse filesystem already available.
...
Starting console mouse services:         [ OK ]

To see your Linux serverâ€™s current runlevel, simply type in the command runlevel.
