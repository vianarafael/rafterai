Next, we 
test our ability to connect from the host with the IP address of 192.168.0.254.

We will use the nc command to make a connection to port 80 on host 192.168.0.1 as in the following 

example:

$ nc 192.168.0.1 80
hello host

The nc program allows us to test the connection between two hosts and send text to the remote host.
