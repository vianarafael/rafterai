This setting 
tells the GlusterFS client that it should wait 15 seconds before giving up and reacquiring all the resources 
from another Gluster peer. This an expensive operation, and really we should delay this action for as long as 
possible. Here, as a demonstration only, we are going to show you how to change it.

We use the gluster volume subcommand to change options on the volume.
