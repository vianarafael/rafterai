smb.conf [global] section

In this example the samba server is a member of WORKGROUP (the default workgroup).
We also set a descriptive server string, this string is visible to users browsing the network
with net view, windows explorer or smbclient.

[root@RHEL52 samba]# head -5 smb.conf
[global]
 workgroup = WORKGROUP
 server string = Public Anonymous File Server
 netbios name = TEACHER0
 security = share

You might have noticed the line with security = share.
