To use the sudo 
command, you simply type sudo and the command you wish to run. You will usually be prompted for your 
password, and if you enter the correct password, the command will be executed.

$ sudo passwd root

This command would change the password of the root user, which is one method of enabling the root 

user on Ubuntu.

The root user is all-powerful and can do anything on your host.
