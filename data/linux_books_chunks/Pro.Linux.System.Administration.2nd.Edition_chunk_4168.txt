In our Pool definition we have made the following changes to the default:

Pool {
  Name = Full
  Pool Type = Backup
  Recycle = yes
  Recycle Oldest Volume = Yes
  AutoPrune = yes
  Volume Retention = 365 days
  Maximum Volume Bytes = 50G
  Maximum Volumes = 100
  Label Format = "Full-${Year}-${Month:p/2/0/r}-${Day:p/2/0/r}"
}

Pool {
  Name = Differential
  Pool Type = Backup
  Recycle = yes
  Recycle Oldest Volume = Yes
  AutoPrune = yes
  Volume Retention = 90 days
  Maximum Volume Bytes = 10G
  Maximum Volumes = 100
  Label Format = "Differential-${Year}-${Month:p/2/0/r}-${Day:p/2/0/r}"
}

Pool {
  Name = Incremental
  Pool Type = Backup
  Recycle = yes
  Recycle Oldest Volume = Yes
  AutoPrune = yes
  Volume Retention = 30 days
  Maximum Volume Bytes = 1G
  Maximum Volumes = 100
  Label Format = "Incremental-${Year}-${Month:p/2/0/r}-${Day:p/2/0/r}"
}

The Name of the Pool will be used to reference the Pool in other resource definitions.
