Similarly, Vagrant will use the 
VBoxManage controlvm <uuid> poweroff command to stop the virtual machine when a vagrant halt is 
called.

Vagrant will also do things like set up up network port forwards (for SSh access and other network 
services if configured to) and mount your file system inside the virtualbox virtual machine (unless you 
configure it not to).

these examples are specific to VirtualBox virtual machinesâ€”but Vagrant supports other virtualization 
and cloud-based instances by issuing the required commands or apI (application programming 
interface) calls to manage them.
