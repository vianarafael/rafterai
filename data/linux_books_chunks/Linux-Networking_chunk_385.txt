installing on RHEL/CentOS

Note that Red Hat derived distributions use httpd as package and process name instead of
apache.

To verify whether apache is installed in CentOS/RHEL:

[root@centos65 ~]# rpm -q httpd
package httpd is not installed
[root@centos65 ~]# ls -l /var/www
ls: cannot access /var/www: No such file or directory

To install apache on CentOS:

[root@centos65 ~]# yum install httpd

After running the yum install httpd command, the Centos 6.5 server has apache installed
and the /var/www directory exists.

[root@centos65 ~]# rpm -q httpd
httpd-2.2.15-30.el6.centos.x86_64
[root@centos65 ~]# ls -l /var/www
total 16
