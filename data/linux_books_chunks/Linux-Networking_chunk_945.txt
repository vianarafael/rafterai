Samba 3 can only be a member server in Active Directory, it cannot manage group
policies. Samba 4 can do this (in beta).

23.1.3. Samba 3

Samba 3 can act as a domain controller in its own domain. In a Windows NT4 domain, with
one Windows NT4 PDC and zero or more BDC's, Samba 3 can only be a member server.
The same is valid for Samba 3 in an Active Directory Domain.
