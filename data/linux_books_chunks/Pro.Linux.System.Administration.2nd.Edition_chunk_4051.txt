Alternatively, we could do something like the 
following:

TARGET_USER=`awk '/aws_access_key_id/ {print $3}' ~.aws/credentials`
TARGET_PASS=`awk '/aws_secret_access_key/ {print $3}' ~.aws/credentials`

Here we use the awk command to search the ~/.aws/credentials file for the access and secret AWS 

keys, printing the third (print $3) column.
