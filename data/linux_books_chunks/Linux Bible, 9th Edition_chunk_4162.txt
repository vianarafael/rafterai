While that is still true to a great extent 
with systemd, you can now also view log messages directly from the systemd journal 
using the journalctl command.

The log ﬁ les for your Linux system are primarily located in the /var/log directory. 
Most of the ﬁ les in the /var/log directory are directed there from the systemd journal 
through the rsyslogd service (see Chapter 13).
