This also helps us 
pin particular version of gems to our git commits and helps us track changes to the gem release versions we 
are using.

$ sudo yum install â€“y ruby rubygems && gem install bundler --no-ri --no-rdoc

Here we are using a CentOS host and install the ruby and rubygems packages and then install into the 

local account the gem bundler (without the associated docs and help for a faster install).

With the Bundler gem installed, we will now create a gem file with the following in our repository 

directory like so:

$ vi Gemfile
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'serverspec'

Here we have added the Serverspec gem to the gemfile.
