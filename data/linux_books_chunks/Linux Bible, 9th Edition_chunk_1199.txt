VAR can be any variable name, and LIST 
can be composed of pretty much any list of values or anything that generates a list.

for NUMBER in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
do
   echo The number is $NUMBER
done

for FILE in `/bin/ls`
do
   echo $FILE
done

You can also write it this way, which is somewhat cleaner:

for NAME in John Paul Ringo George ; do
   echo $NAME is my favorite Beatle
done

Each element in the LIST is separated from the next by whitespace.
