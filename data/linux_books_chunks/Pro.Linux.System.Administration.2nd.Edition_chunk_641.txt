Both searches are for the string localhost.

You can also recursively search down into lower directories by adding the -r switch as follows:

$ grep -r localhost /etc

 ■ Tip 

 On ubuntu and Debian hosts, the rgrep command automatically recurses into directories.

You can also specify more complicated search terms, for example, multiple words, as follows:

$ grep "local host" /etc/hosts

You can see we’ve specified the words “local” and “host” with a space between them.
