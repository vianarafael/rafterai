On CentOS, however, mail-related rsyslog entries are written to the maillog file. You 
can check your hostâ€™s rsyslog.conf configuration file to determine where the information you want will be 
written.

Each line in the rsyslog.conf file is structured into two fields: a selector field and an action field. These 

fields are separated by spaces or a tab.
