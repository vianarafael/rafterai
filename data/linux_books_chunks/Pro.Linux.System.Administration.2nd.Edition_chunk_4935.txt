Unless you have a really strong need, leave this as it is.

In this next section we define the interfaces and ports for our carbon-cache service:

LINE_RECEIVER_INTERFACE = 0.0.0.0
PICKLE_RECEIVER_INTERFACE = 0.0.0.0
CACHE_QUERY_INTERFACE = 0.0.0.0
LINE_RECEIVER_PORT = 2003
PICKLE_RECEIVER_PORT = 2004
CACHE_QUERY_PORT = 7002

Here you can target your listeners to listen on certain IP addresses (IPv4); you should leave the ports as 
the defaults here.
