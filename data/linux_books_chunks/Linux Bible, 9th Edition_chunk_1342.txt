Group permissions in Linux are deﬁ ned by the second of three sets of rwx 
(read, write, execute) bits associated with each ﬁ le and directory.

 ■ gshadow—Contains shadow passwords for groups.

 ■ host.conf—Used by older applications to set the locations in which domain 

names (for example, redhat.com) are searched for on TCP/IP networks (such as 
the Internet).
