Each has the Pool 
Type of Backup, which is currently the only available type, according to the Bareos documentation. We have 
set two different Maximum Volume Bytes, one at 50GB, 10GB, and one at 1GB. This will roll over the volume 
to the next available volume (or Bareos will create a new volume for us) when the volumes reach those size 
limits.
