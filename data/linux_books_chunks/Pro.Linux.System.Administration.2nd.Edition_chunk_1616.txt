We can create a ufw 
application by adding the file /etc/ufw/applications.d/web-server with the following:

[WebServer]
title=Application Web Server
description=Application X web services
ports=80/tcp|443/tcp|8080/tcp

271

CHAPter 7 ■ NetworkiNg AND FirewAllS

To view our new configuration we can use the following command:

$ sudo ufw app info WebServer
sudo: unable to resolve host ubuntu-xenial
Profile: WebServer
Title: Application Web Server
Description: Application X web services

Ports:
 80/tcp
 443/tcp
8080/tcp

After creating an application configuration we need issue the update subcommand like this:

$ sudo ufw app update WebServer

Then to apply the new ruleset you can issue something like this to allow only hosts in the 192.168.0.0/24 

address range.

$ sudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/24 to any app WebServer
Rule added

Let’s break this down a little.
