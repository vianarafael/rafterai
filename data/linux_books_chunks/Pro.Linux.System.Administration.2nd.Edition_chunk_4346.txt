These commands use an 
SSH connection to securely connect to another host and transfer files.

In this example, we’re going to use the sftp command to connect to our branch office server and 

transfer the required files.

[ca]$ sftp jsmith@branch1.example.com
Connecting to branch1.example.com...
jsmith@branch1.example.com's password:
sftp> put branch1.example.com.cert
Uploading /home/jsmith/branch1.example.com.cert to 
/home/jsmith/branch1.example.com.cert
/home/jsmith/branch1.example.com.cert 100%    5881    12.0KB/s    00:03

We have connected to the branch1.example.com host and, using the put command, transferred the 

branch1.example.com.cert certificate file from its location, here the /home/jsmith directory, to the 
equivalent directory /home/jsmith on the branch1 host.
