None of these prevent a client from 
synchronizing with your NTP server, though.

The last set of restrict directives allow for the pool server to become peers, meaning we can query them 

for time information.

restrict source notrap nomodify noquery

Here the source refers to the the pool servers and you will notice that nopeer is not set but the other 

restricts are still in place.

You can further restrict your ntp servers by using cryptographic keys to ensure that only servers that can 

participate in exchanging public key encrypted packets can use your ntp services.
