When you are ﬁ nished using the drive, you can unmount it with the umount 

 command, after which you can safely remove the drive (see the description of the 
umount command later if this command fails):

# umount /dev/sdc1

18.  You don’t usually set up a USB ﬂ ash drive to mount automatically every time the 
system boots because it mounts automatically when you plug it in.
