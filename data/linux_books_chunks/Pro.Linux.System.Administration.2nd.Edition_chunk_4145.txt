If we 
were using a tape drive that did hardware compression on the data as it was written to tape, we would not 
use the software compression here. It also supports other compression formats like LZO, LZ4, and LZ4HC. 
The LZ formats tend to provide greater speed in compression/decompression but a smaller compression 
ratio.
