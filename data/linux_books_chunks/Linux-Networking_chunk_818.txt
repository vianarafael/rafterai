And it shows

So we wait a while, and then run smbtree again, this time it looks a lot nicer.

[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ smbtree

I added the version number of smbtree in the previous screenshot, to show you the difference
when  using  the  latest  version  of  smbtree  (below  a  screenshot  taken  from  Ubuntu  Feisty
Fawn).
