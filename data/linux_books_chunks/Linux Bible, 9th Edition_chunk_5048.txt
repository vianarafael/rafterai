On the Subnet Detail tab, type a comma-separated range of IP 
addresses in the Allocation Pool box. For my example, I chose 
192.168.100.10,192.168.100.50 to hand out a range of IP addresses 
to clients from 192.168.100.10 to 192.168.100.50. Get a name server sug-
gestion from the administrator of your OpenStack cloud or use a public 
DNS server (such as Googleâ€™s 8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4).
