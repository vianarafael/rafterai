To place a program in the background at the time 
you run the program, type an ampersand (&) at the end of the command line, like this:

$ find /usr > /tmp/allusrfiles &
[3] 15971

This example command ﬁ nds all ﬁ les on your Linux system (starting from /usr), 
prints those ﬁ lenames, and puts those names in the ﬁ le /tmp/allusrfiles. The 
ampersand (&) runs that command line in the background.
