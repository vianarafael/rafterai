Here are some of the 
advantages:

 ■ Improve performance by moving VMs from hypervisors that are overloaded to ones 

that have more available memory and CPU capacity.

 ■ Do routine maintenance on a hypervisor while keeping your VMs running.

 ■ Move VMs off underutilized hypervisors so you can shut them off to save energy 

until they are needed again.

 ■ Move VMs off site if you are expecting to shut down a datacenter or expecting a 

hurricane or other catastrophe to hit your datacenter.

Live migration, in particular, is valuable if you need work to continue on the VMs without 
interruption.
