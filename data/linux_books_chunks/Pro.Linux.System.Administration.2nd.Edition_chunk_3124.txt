show you how to configure which address and port Squid should listen on and how to configure it so your 
users are actually permitted to access the Web via the cache.

Squid listens on port 3128 on all network interfaces by default, though port 8080 is used commonly 

as well. The directive to modify the port in the configuration file is http_port.
