You may not convey a covered work if you 
are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing 
software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your 
activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the 
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) 
in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those 
copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with speciÔ¨Å c products or compilations that 
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license 
was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or 
other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable 
patent law.
