The RSA algorithm can be used for both 
encryption and creating signatures, while DSA can be used only for creating digital signatures.

As you can see, a digital signature contains both cryptographic hashing and  asymmetric 
key cryptography. This complicated process is often handled by an application that 
has been conÔ¨Å gured to do so, instead of being directly handled by Linux system users.
