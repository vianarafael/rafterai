We will use grok to search for the string containing the epoch and the unique ID and 
extract them as labels for us.

    grok {
      match => { "msg" => "audit\(%{NUMBER:audit_epoch}:%{NUMBER:audit_counter}\):" }
    }

Here we are telling grok to match the msg key and find the audit(<somenumber>:<somenumber): string.
