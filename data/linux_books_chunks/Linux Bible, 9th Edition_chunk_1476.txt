When the BIOS screen appears, 
look for a message that tells you to press a particular function key (such as F12) 
to interrupt the boot process and select the boot medium. Select the DVD or USB 
drive, depending on which you have, and Fedora should come up and display the 
boot screen. When you see the boot screen, select Start Fedora Live.

3.  Start the installation.
