This License gives no permission to license 
the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have 
separately received it.

d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal 
Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display 
Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not 
by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as 
to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an 
“aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or 
legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit.
