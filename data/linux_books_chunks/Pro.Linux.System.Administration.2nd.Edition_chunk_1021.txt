Both show a similar GRUB2 boot 

menu that allows you to select which kernel you would like to run with your arrow keys. CentOS presents 
the two menu entries that we talked about earlier, one being the kernel and the other described as a rescue 
kernel. On Ubuntu you will see a sub-menu entry called Advanced Options.
