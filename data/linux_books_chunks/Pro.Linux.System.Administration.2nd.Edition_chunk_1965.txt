these tools are still present, but some of the functionality they 
provide is not present in aptitude or is not easily accessible, so it pays to become familiar with them. 
the commands that make up APt include apt-get, apt-cache, and apt-file. the apt-get command 
downloads, installs, and removes packages and source files.
