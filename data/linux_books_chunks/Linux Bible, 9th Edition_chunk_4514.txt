Part V: Learning Linux Security Techniques

The ls -Z example displays four items associated with the ﬁ le that are speciﬁ c to 
SELinux:

 ■ A user (unconfined_u)

 ■ A role (object_r)

 ■ A type (user_home_t)

 ■ A level (s0)

These four RBAC items (user, role, type, and level) are used in the SELinux access control 
to determine appropriate access levels.
