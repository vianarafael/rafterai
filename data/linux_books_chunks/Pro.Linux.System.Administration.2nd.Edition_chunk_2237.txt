The mount point can be on 
a partition that was also mounted separately.

 â–  Tip  Keep in mind that entries in the /etc/fstab file are processed in order from top to bottom.

The filesystem type tells the system which type to expect. If this does not match, the mount will fail. You 

can specify a comma-separated list of types to try, as is the case with the DVD-ROM drive, /dev/scd0.
