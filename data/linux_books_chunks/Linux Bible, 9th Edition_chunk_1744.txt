Here’s an example of /etc/yum.conf on a RHEL 7 system:

[main]
cachedir=/var/cache/yum/$basearch/$releasever
keepcache=0
debuglevel=2
logfile=/var/log/yum.log
exactarch=1

gpgcheck=1
plugins=1

Settings in yum.conf tell YUM where to keep cache ﬁ les (/var/cache/yum) and log 
entries (/var/log/yum.log), and whether to keep cache ﬁ les around after a package is 
installed (0 means no).
