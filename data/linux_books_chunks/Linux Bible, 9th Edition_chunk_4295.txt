However, a potential 
vulnerability has been discovered. A key pair set is generated using two prime random numbers. The idea is that no 
two key pairs would be identical. Security researchers have discovered that the random numbers generated are not 
that random. Thus, there is the potential to have the same key pair as someone else on the Internet.
