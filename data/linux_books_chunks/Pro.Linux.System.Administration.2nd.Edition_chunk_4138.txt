This setting helps prioritize jobs; the lower the number, 

the higher the priority Bareos will give to the job. Some settings in the JobDefs can be overridden by 
definitions in other areas, like in the Job, Schedule, and Client definitions.

Jobs

Jobs define the actual backups that can occur. The most basic job must have a name, a client, a JobDefs 
name, and if it is enabled.
