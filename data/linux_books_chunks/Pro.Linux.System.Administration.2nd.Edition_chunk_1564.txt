Netfilter has four built-in tables that can hold rules for processing traffic. The first is the 
filter table, which is the default table used for all rules related to the filtering of your traffic. The second is 
nat, which handles NAT rules. Next is the mangle table, which covers a variety of packetÂ alteration functions.
