When building a RPM package we require at least the SPECS and SOURCES in the directories above. 
BUILD is where we build our packages. RPMS is where our packages will be placed after the build. SOURCES 
is where we place the source files for building. SPECS is where our spec file will be placed. SRPMS is where 
our RPM source files will be.
