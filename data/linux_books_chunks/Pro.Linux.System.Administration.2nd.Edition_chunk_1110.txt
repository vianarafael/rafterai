This should be the main process of the daemon, unless you are going to fork the process (with Type=fork).

The Restart option controls how systemd monitors the service and reacts to any issues. The options are 
“no,” “on-success,” “on-failure,” “on-abnormal,” “on-watchdog,” “on-abort,” or “always.” The rsyslog service is 
set to restart on failure and the default is “no” if not set.
