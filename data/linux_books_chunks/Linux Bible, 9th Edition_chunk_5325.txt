If 
connecting to the web server succeeds after that, you need to correct SELinux ﬁ le 
context and/or Boolean issues (probably ﬁ le context in this case). The following 
should work:

# chcon --reference=/var/www/html /var/www/html/index.html

If the chmod command works, it means that the apache user and group did not 
have read permission to the ﬁ le.
