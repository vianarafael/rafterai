The potential downside is that you can kill more processes than you mean to if you 
are not careful. (For example, typing killall bash may kill a bunch of shells that you 
don’t mean to kill.)

Like the kill command, killall uses SIGTERM (signal 15) if you don’t explicitly enter 
a signal number. Also as with kill, you can send any signal you like to the process you 
name with killall.
