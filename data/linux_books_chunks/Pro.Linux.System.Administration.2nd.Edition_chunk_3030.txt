If you have a lot of client browsers, this can add a lot of 
overhead and maintenance to your environment. In many cases, such as a web site, you donâ€™t have access 
to the clients, and these errors may result in someone getting the message that the client cannot validate the 
certificate and hence not trust your web site.
