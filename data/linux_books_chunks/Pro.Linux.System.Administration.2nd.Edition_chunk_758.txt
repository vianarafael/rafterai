The HOME option specifies the directory in which all new home directories should be 
created. The SKEL option specifies which directory to use to populate the user’s home directory, and as we 
discussed earlier, this defaults to /etc/skel. The GROUP option specifies the default group ID (GID) to use. 
It is set to group 100, or the “users” group, and you generally won’t ever need to change this.
