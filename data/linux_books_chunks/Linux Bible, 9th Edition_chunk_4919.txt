To check that you got the mount entry correct, run the 
 following command to mount all entries in the /etc/fstab ﬁ le that have not 
already been mounted and check that the NFS share was mounted:

# mount -a
# mount | grep libvirt
storage.example.com:/var/storage on /var/lib/libvirt/images type
nfs4
(rw,relatime,vers=4.0,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,namlen=255,hard,
proto=tcp,port=0,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,
clientaddr=192.168.0.1,local_lock=none,addr=192.168.0.138)

With your hypervisors and storage now in place, you can now begin creating your virtual 
machines.

Creating virtual machines
The Virtual Machine Manager (virt-manager) is a good tool to use to create your ﬁ rst 
virtual machines.
