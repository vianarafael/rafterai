When using SCSI (small computer system
interface), each device gets a unique scsi id. The scsi controller also needs a scsi id, do not
use this id for a scsi-attached device.

Older 8-bit SCSI is now called narrow, whereas 16-bit is wide. When the bus speeds was
doubled to 10Mhz, this was known as fast SCSI.
