As the option sharedscripts is enabled, the script will be run only once no matter how many 
individual log files are rotated. The script statement is terminated with the endscript option.

So, how does logrotate run? By default on both CentOS and Ubuntu, cron runs logrotate at 

scheduled times (through a script /etc/cron.daily; it is executed by Anacron).
