This is often 
done with one of the following:

 ■ su command—Often, su is used to open a shell as root user. After it is open, the 
administrator can run multiple commands and then exit to return to a shell as a 
regular user.

 ■ sudo command—With sudo, a regular user is given root privileges, but only when 
that user runs the sudo command to run another command.
