tracing with strace

More detailed tracing of all function calls can be done with strace. We start by creating a
read only file.

root@deb503:~# echo hello > 42.txt
root@deb503:~# chmod 400 42.txt 
root@deb503:~# ls -l 42.txt 
-r-------- 1 root root 6 2011-09-26 12:03 42.txt

We open the file with vi, but include the strace command with an output file for the trace
before vi.
