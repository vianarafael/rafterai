First thing to do is discover the disk layout.

[root@RHEL5 ~]# df -h 
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda2              15G  4.5G  9.3G  33% /
/dev/sda1              99M   31M   64M  33% /boot

The /boot partition is small but big enough. If we create an identical partition, then dd should
be a good cloning option.
