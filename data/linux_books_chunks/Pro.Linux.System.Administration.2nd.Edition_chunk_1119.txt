It was a reworking and expansion of the SysV 
Init paradigm; rather than outright replacing SysV Init, the designers created Upstart to emulate SysV Init 
until everyone converted over.

The init process under Upstart is an event-based daemon that uses event triggers to start or stop 
processes. An event is a change of state that init can be informed of.
