Install the virtual machine. You are prompted to install the system just as you 
would be if you were installing directly to hardware. Complete the installation, 
and reboot the virtual machine. If the VM window isnâ€™t open, double-click the VM 
entry (in this case, fedora21) in the virt-manager window and log in.
