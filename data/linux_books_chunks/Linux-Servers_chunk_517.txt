A NAT can hide private addresses from the internet.

NAT was developed to mitigate the use of real ip addresses, to allow private address ranges
to  reach  the  internet  and  back,  and  to  not  disclose  details  about  internal  networks  to  the
outside.

The nat table in iptables adds two new chains. PREROUTING allows altering of packets
before they reach the INPUT chain.
