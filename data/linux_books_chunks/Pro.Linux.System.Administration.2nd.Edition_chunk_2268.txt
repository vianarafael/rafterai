There are several ways to combat this. One is to use LVM which can group multiple disks and present 
them as one device, or you can use BtrFS which can do a similar thing. In this section we are going to show 
you another alternative, RAID.

RAID allows you to use multiple disks as if they were a single larger disk, with optional built-in 

redundancy.
