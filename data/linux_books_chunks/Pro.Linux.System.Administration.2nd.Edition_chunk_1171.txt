So systemctl 
provides a way of condensing the same information to make it easy for a program to detect the status.

$ sudo systemctl is-active postfix.service ; echo $?
active
0

The above command provides both the state (“active,” “inactive”) to the standard output and an exit 
code (0 for active, non-zero for other state)—both of which you can test for in a script or program that might 
manage the service.
