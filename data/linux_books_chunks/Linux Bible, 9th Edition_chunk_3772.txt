To troubleshoot a problem, you 
may need to disable a device.

For example, let’s say your computer has two network interface cards (NICs). You 
want to use the second NIC to install Linux over a network, but the installer keeps 
trying to use the ﬁ rst NIC to connect to the network. You can disable the ﬁ rst NIC 
so the installer doesn’t even see the NIC when it tries to connect to the network.
