Create a directory in your home directory called projects. In the projects 

directory, create nine empty ﬁ les that are named house1, house2, house3, and 
so on to house9. Assuming there are lots of other ﬁ les in that directory, come up 
with a single argument to ls that would list just those nine ﬁ les.

2.  Make the $HOME/projects/houses/doors/ directory path.
