RAID level 5 uses a minimum of three disks and gives you more efficient use of the 
available storage space and increased read and write speed. It accomplishes this by striping the data across 
multiple disks and also writing a checksum of each stripe to a different disk (also known as block parity - for 
details on how this is calcuated see http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/parity).
