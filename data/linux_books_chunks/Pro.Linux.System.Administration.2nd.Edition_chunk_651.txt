The –o says to only 
print the results of the match, otherwise you will see the whole line the match appears on. The –E says 
to use the eRe version (though we have said the eRe and BRe are the same here). Taking a look at the 
expression itself, first we look for one to three occurrences {1,3} of numbers between 0 and 9 [0-9] 
followed by a dot.

[0-9]{1,3}\.

This will match 0. up to 999.
