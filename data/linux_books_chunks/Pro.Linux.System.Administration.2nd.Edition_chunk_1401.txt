The /etc/rc.d/rc.local file needs to have the execute bit set (chmod +x rc.local) and 
because we are running systemd and not SysVInit we need to make sure that systemd will execute it when 
we restart our system. If you remember from Chapter 6 we do that by executing the following:

$ sudo systemctl enable rc-local.service

That is how we can manage different types of interfaces under CentOS.
