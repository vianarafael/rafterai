/etc/sysctl.conf

By  default,  most  Linux  computers  are  not  configured  for  automatic  packet  forwarding.
To enable packet forwarding whenever the system starts, change the net.ipv4.ip_forward
variable in /etc/sysctl.conf to the value 1.

root@router~# grep ip_forward /etc/sysctl.conf 
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0
