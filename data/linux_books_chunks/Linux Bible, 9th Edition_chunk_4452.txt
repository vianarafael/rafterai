One important security module is pam_cracklib.

Enforcing good passwords with PAM
When a password is modiÔ¨Å ed, the PAM module pam_cracklib is involved in the process. 
The module prompts the user for a password and checks its strength against a system 
 dictionary and a set of rules for identifying poor choices.

The pam_cracklib module is installed by default on Fedora and RHEL.
