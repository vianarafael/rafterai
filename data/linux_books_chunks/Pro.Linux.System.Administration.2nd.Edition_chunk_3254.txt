Both Ubuntu and 
CentOS store these files in different locations, but both use symlinks to make sure the files appear in similar 
locations.

 See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox for more details of the mbox format.

On Ubuntu, a mailbox file named for the user is created in the /var/mail directory, for example, /var/

mail/ataylor.
