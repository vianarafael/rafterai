You can use a couple of commands to change the security contexts under which 
a program is run:

 ■ runcon—Run the program using options to determine the user, role, and type (aka 

domain).

 ■ sandbox—Run the program within a tightly controlled domain (aka sandbox).

You can cause several problems by using runcon, so use it with caution. However, 
sandbox offers a great deal of protection.
