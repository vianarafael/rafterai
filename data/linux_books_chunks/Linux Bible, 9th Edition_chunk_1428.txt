The parport_pc module lets you optionally 
deﬁ ne the addresses and IRQ numbers associated with each device sharing the parallel 
port. For example:

# modprobe parport_pc io=0x3bc irq=auto

In this example, a device is identiﬁ ed as having an address of 0x3bc, and the IRQ for the 
device is auto-detected.

The modprobe command loads modules temporarily—they disappear at the next reboot.
