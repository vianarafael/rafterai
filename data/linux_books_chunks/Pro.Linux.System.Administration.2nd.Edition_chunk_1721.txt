even large companies with very expensive equipment 
can be subject to these attacks.

while keeping your network secure is a constant process, you can do a few things to minimize your 
risks:

• 

• 

• 

track security alert mailing lists for your hosts.

keep your hosts up to date with the latest security patches.

Close off unwanted ports and services.

•  get to know your logs and learn to detect anything that looks odd.

• 

review your security every six months at minimum to make sure it is still working 
properly.

• 

Use an upstream DDoS mitigation service to help protect your network.

Nothing connected to the internet is 100% secure, but you can take measures that ensure your network 
isn’t one of those with a well-known vulnerability.
