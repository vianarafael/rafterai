This is how e-mail began—

 ■ Note 
people with login accounts on connected unix machines sending each other messages. The @ symbol was 
first used for this purpose in 1971! You can read about it at http://openmap.bbn.com/~tomlinso/ray/ 
firstemailframe.html.

Next you see a ~ symbol, which is an abbreviated method of referring to your home directory.
