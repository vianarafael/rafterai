After the initial rsync copy of the remote data to our host, any subsequent 
copy will be compared against what we already have. rsync does this by sending a file list of the data it wants 
to copy to the receiving host. The file list includes the pathnames of the data we want to back up and also 
the permissions, ownership, size, modtimes, and, if specified, checksums of the files.
