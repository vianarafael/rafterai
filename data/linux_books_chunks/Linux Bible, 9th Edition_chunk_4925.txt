Using Network Address Translation (NAT), the host can 
route packets from the virtual machines using these private addresses to external network 
interfaces.

Do the following on each hypervisor to check the bridge for each:

# brctl show virbr0
bridge name  bridge id            STP enabled  interfaces
virbr0      8000.001aa0d7483e    yes           vnet0
# ip addr show virbr0
5: virbr0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue 
        state UP group default
   link/ether fe:54:00:57:71:67 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
   inet 192.168.122.1 brd 192.168.122.255 scope global dynamic virbr0

Step 3: Start Virtual Machine Manager (virt-manager)
From the desktop on either hypervisor, do the following to open Virtual Machine Manager 
and connect it to the hypervisor:
