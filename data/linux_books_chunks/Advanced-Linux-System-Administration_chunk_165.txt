Another way of doing this is to use the 'ALT+sysreq+s' key combination  

badblocks - search a device for bad blocks

It is recommended NOT to use badblocks directly but to use the -c flag with fsck or mkfs.

Main options:

-b

-c

-i

-o

block size

number of blocks tested at a time

file with a list of known bad blocks, these blocks will be skipped

output file, passed to mkfs 

mke2fs - create an ext2/3 filesyste

Main options:

-b

-i

-N

-m

-c

-l

-L

blocksize

number of bytes between consecutive inodes 'bytes-per-inode'

number of inodes

Percentage of blocks reserved for user root

Check for bad blocks

Read bad blocks from  file

Set a volume LABEL

-j/-J Create journal (ext3) 

-T

Optimise filesystem “type”, values are:

news
largefile   
largefile4  

one inode per 4kb block
one inode per megabyte
one inode per 4 megabytes

dumpe2fs - dump filesystem information

dumpe2fs  prints  the  super block and blocks group information for the filesystem present 
on a device
