If you don’t 
select a profile to be installed, Cobbler will automatically launch the first item on the menu (local), which 
continues the boot process on the localhost.

 ■ Note 

 if you don’t have an operating system installed on this host, the local boot process will obviously fail.

We will select CentOS7-x86_64, which will automatically install CentOS onto our host.
