Booting to single-user mode, or maintenance mode, using the GRUB2 menu

You’ll see the details here as you saw in the grub.cfg menuentry. The line we are interested in this 
particular example is the linux /vmlinuz-4.4.0-15-generic.efi.signed… line. Use the arrow keys to 
navigate to the end of that line.
