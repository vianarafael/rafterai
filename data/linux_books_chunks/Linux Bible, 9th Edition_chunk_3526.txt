Note that a dot is required at the end of the network number. The 
192.168.5.0/255.255.255.0 example uses netmask notation to identify 192.168.5 as the set of 
addresses that are allowed.

In the third line of the sample code, any host from the .example.com network is allowed, as 
is the individual host market.example.net.
