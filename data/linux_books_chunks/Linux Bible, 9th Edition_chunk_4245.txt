The following are Linux distributions you can use to conduct very thorough penetra-
tion tests:

 ■ BackTrack (www.backtrack-linux.org)

 ■ Linux distribution created speciﬁ cally for penetration testing

 ■ Can be used from a live DVD or a ﬂ ash drive

 ■ Training on use of BackTrack offered by www.offensive-security.com

 ■ Fedora Security Spin (http://spins.fedoraproject.org/security)

While penetration testing is lots of fun, for a thorough compliance review, a little more is 
needed.
