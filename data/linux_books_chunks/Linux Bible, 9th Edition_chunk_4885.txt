You 
should check these things on your computer before you start installing:

 ■ Support virtualization—You can check for virtualization support by looking at 

the ﬂ ags set in the CPU.

 ■ Memory—The computer must have enough RAM not only to run the host operating 

system, but for each virtual machine that you expect to run on the system.

 ■ Processing power—Keep in mind that each virtual machine consumes processing 

power for itself and any application running inside the virtual machine.

Storage is another consideration.
