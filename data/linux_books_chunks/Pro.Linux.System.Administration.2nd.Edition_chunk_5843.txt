We do that with the serverspec-init command.

$ serverspec-init
Select OS type:

  1) UN*X
  2) Windows

Select number: 1

We are asked what type of OS we are going to test; here we choose 1) UN*X.

Select a backend type:

  1) SSH
  2) Exec (local)

Select number: 1

We can now choose how we are going to access the host: either run serverspec commands locally or 
use SSH to sign into a host and run commands from inside that host.
