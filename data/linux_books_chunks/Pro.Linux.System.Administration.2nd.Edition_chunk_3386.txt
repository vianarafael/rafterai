Both types are specified 
with the relayhost configuration option in the main.cf configuration file (see www.postfix.org/
postconf.5.html#relayhost) like so, where mail.isp.net is the hostname of your smarthost:

relayhost = mail.isp.net

this will tell your postfix e-mail server to send all outgoing e-mail to mail.isp.net.
