Here is an example:

$ /usr/sbin/lpc status
hp:    
               printer is on device 'usb' speed -1
               queuing is enabled
               printing is disabled
               no entries
               daemon present
deskjet_5550:
               printer is on device '/dev/null' speed -1
               queuing is enabled
               printing is disabled
               no entries
               daemon present

This output shows two active printers.
