With the Puppet 
resource we will start puppetserver and make it start on boot like this:

sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet resource service puppetserver ensure=running enable=true

We have not yet described how Puppet manages resources, and you will get a deeper understanding of 

what this command is doing shortly, but briefly what this is doing is the following:

•	

Starting a service (ensure=running)

•	 Making the necessary changes to start a service at boot (enable=true)

•	 Using whatever underlying system to start the service (service puppetserver)

In our case, it will use systemctl commands (start and enable) under the hood.
