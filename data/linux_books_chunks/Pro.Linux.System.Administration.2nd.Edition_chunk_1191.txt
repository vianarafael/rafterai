If you run the systemctl command without any options or 
arguments you get a full list of every loaded unit definition (unit file) systemd has loaded. We are reducing 
this list by add the --type of unit we are interested in and the --state of that unit. You can see in that list that 
our postfix.service is loaded, active, and running.
