Upstart is “evented,” meaning it can react to events on your system. The start on filesystem means that 
when the filesystem “event” takes place, we will automatically start rsyslog too. The stop on configuration 
option is an event definition signalling Upstart to stop rsyslogd when a runlevel 0 or 6 event is detected.
