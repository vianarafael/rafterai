So the file isn't a list of all filesystems supported 
by the kernel!

/proc/partitions
The partition layout is displayed with further information such as the name, the number of 
block, the major/minor numbers, etc

/proc/sys/
The /proc/sys directory is the only place were files with write permission can be found 
(the rest of /proc is read-only).
