The child process from above is now the parent process.

[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ bash
[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ echo $$ $PPID
4812 4224

Typing exit will end the current process and brings us back to our original values for $$
and $PPID.

[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ echo $$ $PPID
4812 4224
[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ exit
exit
[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ echo $$ $PPID
4224 4223
[paul@RHEL4b ~]$
