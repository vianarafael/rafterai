Those ports immediately become open.

For RHEL 6 or older Fedora releases, add rules to the /etc/sysconfig/iptables ﬁ le 
(somewhere before a ﬁ nal DROP or REJECT) such as the following:

-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT

Restart  iptables  (service iptables restart) for the new rules to take effect.
