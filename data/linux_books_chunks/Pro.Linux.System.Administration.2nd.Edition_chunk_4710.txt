For example, if we want to make sure that the DN cn=webadmin
,ou=meta,dc=example,dc=com, which is the user we use to bind our web services during authentication, has 
auth access to the userPassword attribute of our user Angela Taylor, we would issue the following:

sudo slapacl -F /etc/ldap/slapd.d \
  -b uid=ataylor,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com \
  -D cn=webadmin,ou=meta,dc=example,dc=com \
  -o tls_ssf=128 \
  -v userPassword/auth

The slapacl command requires sudo access.
