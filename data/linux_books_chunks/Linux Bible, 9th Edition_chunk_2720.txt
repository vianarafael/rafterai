Another even more modern init 
daemon is systemd.

Understanding systemd initialization
The systemd initialization daemon is the newer replacement for the SysVinit and the 
Upstart init daemons. This modern initialization daemon currently runs on Fedora 15 
and above and RHEL 7 and above, and is backward compatible with both SysVinit and 
Upstart.
