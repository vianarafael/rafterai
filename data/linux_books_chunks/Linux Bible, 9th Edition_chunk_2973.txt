Using this example, employ the following form for printing:

$ cat file1.ps | lpr -P NS1-PS

If you are receiving failure messages, make sure the computer to which you are printing is accessible. For the Printer 
NS1 hp example, you can type smbclient -L NS1 -U jjones. Then type the password (my9passswd, in 
this case).
