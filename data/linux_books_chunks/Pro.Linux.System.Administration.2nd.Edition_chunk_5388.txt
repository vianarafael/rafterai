Instead of entering a 
passphrase for the key, we press Enter to specify an empty passphrase, because we need the connection to 
be made without a passphrase or password prompt.

We then need to copy the public key, id_rsa.pub, to the remote host and store it in the authorized_

keys file for the user weâ€™re going to connect to.
