Doing so allows you to 
use the available storage space more efficiently and, in some cases, improve performance as well. To create 
a new RAID 5 array, you need to disassemble the RAID 1 array first. By stopping it, you release all devices it 
uses:

$ sudo mdadm --manage /dev/md0 --stop
mdadm: stopped /dev/md0

You can now use these devices for the new RAID 5 array.
