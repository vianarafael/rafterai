By specifying the –a (for append) option, the 
-G option, and the name of the new group to join (the group must already exist), we add the ataylor user to 
the accounts group.

 ■ Tip 
 You can change many of the aspects of a user with the usermod command, and we recommend 
reading its man page for further information.
