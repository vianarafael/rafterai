In general, the type should conform to the following:

<scheme://><uid>:<password>@<other.host>/<some_dir>

We are going to use the S3 scheme that does not require user and password information in the URL.

TARGET='s3://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/our-backup/nightly'

This is similar to the URL we used to copy our test file via the aws cli command.
