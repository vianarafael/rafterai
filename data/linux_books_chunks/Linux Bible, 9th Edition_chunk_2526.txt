(SOCKS is a network protocol made to 
allow client computers to access the Internet through a ﬁ rewall.) You can identify a proxy 
server in NetworkManager and have communications for selected protocols go through that 
server (select Network proxy in the Network Settings window).

Instead of identifying a proxy server to your network interfaces (via NetworkManager), you 
can conﬁ gure your browser to use a proxy server directly by changing your Firefox prefer-
ences to use a proxy server.
