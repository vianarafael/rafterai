about computer accounts

Every NT computer (Windows NT, 2000, XP, Vista) can become a member of a domain.
Joining the domain (by right-clicking on My Computer) means that a computer account will
be created in the domain. This computer account also has a password (but you cannot know
it) to prevent other computers with the same name from accidentally becoming member of
the domain.
