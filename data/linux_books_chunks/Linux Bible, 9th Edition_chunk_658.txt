Here are some of the values you can type partially from a bash shell:

 ■ Command, alias, or function—If the text you type begins with regular 
characters, the shell tries to complete the text with a command, alias, or 
function name.

3

 ■ Variable—If the text you type begins with a dollar sign ($), the shell completes 

the text with a variable from the current shell.

 ■ Username—If the text you type begins with a tilde (~), the shell completes the 

text with a username.
