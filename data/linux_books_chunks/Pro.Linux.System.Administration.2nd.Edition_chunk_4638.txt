try and demand will fail connections for 
unverified certificates.

We apply tls.ldif with ldapmodify like before.

$ sudo ldapmodify -Q -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -f tls.ldif

We can validate that we can still use the root user to query the LDAP server and view our TLS entries.

$ sudo ldapsearch -H ldapi:/// -Y EXTERNAL -b "cn=config" -LLL  -Q |grep TLS
olcTLSCACertificateFile: /etc/ldap/certs/cacert.pem
olcTLSCertificateFile: /etc/ldap/certs/ldap.example.com.cert
olcTLSCertificateKeyFile: /etc/ldap/certs/ldap.example.com.key

We will not be able to issue ldapsearch requests against the ldap:/// URI until we make some 
adjustments to the /etc/ldap/ldap.conf file.
