Running that command causes the package you name to be 
downloaded from the YUM repository and copied to your current directory.

For example, to download the latest version of the Firefox web browser package from the 
YUM repository to your current directory, type the following:

# yumdownloader firefox
...(1/2): firefox-35.0-3.fc21.x86_64.rpm         |  68 MB  00:00:09
(2/2): firefox-35.0-3.fc21.i686.rpm           |  68 MB  00:00:10

In this case, because x86_64 and i686 versions of the Ô¨Å refox package are available, both 
are downloaded to the current directory.
