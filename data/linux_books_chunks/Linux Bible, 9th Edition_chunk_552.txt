On UNIX systems, from which Linux was derived, the program used to inter-
pret and manage commands was referred to as the shell.

No matter which Linux distribution you are using, you can always count on the fact that the shell 
is available to you. It provides a way to create executable script ﬁ les, run programs, work with 
ﬁ lesystems, compile computer code, and manage the computer.
