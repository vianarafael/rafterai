Here 
is an example of how to add a Samba password for the user jim:

# smbpasswd -a jim
New SMB password: *******
Retype new SMB password: *******

After running that smbpasswd command, jim can use that username and password to 
access the Samba server. The /var/lib/samba/private/passdb.tdb Ô¨Å le holds the 
password just entered for jim.
