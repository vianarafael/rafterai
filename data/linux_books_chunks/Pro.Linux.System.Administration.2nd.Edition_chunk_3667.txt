Kerberos is installed as part of the automatic installation of Samba. Since 
we have only one Samba server, it is not really required unless we are joining another Active Directory domain 
controller or we want to authenticate our Linux user accounts via the Samba service as a single sign-on authority.
Before we can test our Kerberos configuration, we first need to create a symlink.
