In many ways, similar chaos can occur by not closely manag-
ing the SetUID (SUID) and the SetGID (SGID) permissions (see Chapters 4 and 11).

Files with the SUID permission in the Owner category and execute permission in the 
Other category allow anyone to temporarily become the ﬁ le’s owner while the ﬁ le is being 
executed in memory.
