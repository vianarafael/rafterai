Like Windows, users can have their own environment, storage, access controls, and 
permissions.

Finally, you see the $ symbol. This symbol tells you what type of user you are; by default all normal users 

on the host will have $ as their prompt. There is a special user, called root, whose prompt uses the # symbol:

root@au-mel-centos-1 ~#

The root user is the superuser.
