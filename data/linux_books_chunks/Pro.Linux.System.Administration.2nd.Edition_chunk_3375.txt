To do this, we are 

going to use Python.

$ python  -c 'import base64; print base64.b64encode("jsmith")'
anNtaXRo
$ python  -c 'import base64; print base64.b64encode("secret")'
c2VjcmV0

In the previous snippet, we have used the python command to execute (-c) the code that will create 
a base64 encoding of the username and password we need.
