You can also use MDas to generate out-of-office notices, 
forward particular e-mails to others, and perform a variety of other tasks.

You can also call other applications from some MDas. For example, some people don’t run spam filters 
in their Mta, instead running a spam filter with their MDa.

in this chapter we are going to be using Dovecot to deliver mail from the Mta to the user’s mailboxes.
