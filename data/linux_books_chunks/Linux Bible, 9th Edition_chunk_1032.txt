Multitasking means that many programs can be running at the same time. An instance of a 
running program is referred to as a process. Linux provides tools for listing running processes, 

monitoring system usage, and stopping (or killing) processes when necessary.

From a shell, you can launch processes, and then pause, stop, or kill them.
