If you use NetworkManager over a wired or wireless Ethernet connec-
tion, address and server information needed to start up can be automatically obtained from 
a DHCP server.

With NetworkManager’s graphical interface, you can do some network conﬁ guration, if 
you like. You can set static IP addresses and select the name server and gateway comput-
ers to use.
