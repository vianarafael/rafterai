Let’s Encrypt is a free 
CA that will automatically create, request, and sign certificates, primarily for web servers. We are going to be 
using Let’s Encrypt for many of our services as it is a secure and convenient way to encrypt all your traffic.
How does it work? Well, like we said, the heart of it is just like a normal CA.
