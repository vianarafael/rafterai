In the Node block we are setting the relay host and port. 

We can add prefixes to our metrics and suffixes as well. Here we are adding collectd_ as a prefix to each 
metric to more easily track the metric origins.

We can now restart the Collectd, service and metrics should begin to be sent via the relay to the monitor 

server.
