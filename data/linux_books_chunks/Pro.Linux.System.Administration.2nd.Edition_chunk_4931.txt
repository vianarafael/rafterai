MAX_UPDATES_PER_SECOND and MAX_CREATES_PER_MINUTE are set to limit high disk I/O 
contention.

CACHE_WRITE_STRATEGY can have three possible settings.

•	

•	

•	

sorted (default): Data points are flushed to disk as an ordered list.

max: Frequently updated data points are flushed to disk, and infrequent data points 
will be flushed at shutdown or low disk I/O periods (if there are any).

naive : Data points are flushed in an unordered list.

There is further detail on these settings in comments of the carbon.conf file.
