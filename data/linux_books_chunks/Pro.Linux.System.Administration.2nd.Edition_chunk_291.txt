Later in the book we will be using Puppet and Ansible, the 
configuration management tools, to deploy our server configurations and we will be using the combination 
of VirtualBox, Vagrant, and Git to achieve and track this.

The ability to share and download Vagrant boxes, or shared VirtualBox machines, means that you 
quickly integrate or trial different technology.
