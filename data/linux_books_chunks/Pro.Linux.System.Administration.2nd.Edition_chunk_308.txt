VirtualBox has its own VdI format as well 
as supporting VMWare’s VMdK (Virtual Machine disk), Microsoft’s Vhd (Virtual hard disk), Mac oSx’s hdd 
(parallels hard disk), QeMu Qed (QeMu enhanced disk), and QCoW (QeMu Copy-on-Write). these filesystems 
are all on disk files (meaning the “disks” are really just files on the filesystem and can be copied and moved 
just like any other file).
