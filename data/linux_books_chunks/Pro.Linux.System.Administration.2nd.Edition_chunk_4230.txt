We can execute the following:

$ sudo mkfs.xfs -f -L brick3_r1 /dev/sdf && \
   sudo mkdir -p /data/brick3_r1 && \
   sudo bash -c 'echo LABEL=brick3_r1 /data/brick3_r1 xfs defaults 1 2 >> /etc/fstab' && \
   sudo mount â€“a && \
   sudo mkdir /data/brick3_r1/backups

We have seen this command previously, and we are formatting the disks, making the directories where 

we will mount the devices, adding the disks to automount in our fstab, mounting the device, and finally 
creating a backup directory on the mounted disk.
