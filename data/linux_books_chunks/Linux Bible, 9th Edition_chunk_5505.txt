Our General Public 
Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free 
software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you 
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that 
you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking 
you to surrender the rights.
