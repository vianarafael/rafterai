For example, if output appears from a command run-
ning in the background during a vi session, simply press Ctrl+L to redraw the screen to 
get rid of the output.

To avoid having the output appear, you should have any process running in the background send its output to a fi le or 
to null (add 2> /dev/null to the end of the command line).

Starting background processes
If you have programs that you want to run while you continue to work in the shell, you can 
place the programs in the background.
