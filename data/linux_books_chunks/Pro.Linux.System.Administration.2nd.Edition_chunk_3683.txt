If you were to use the classic domain controller, you would set it here (NT4). The 
server services directive defines the services that this server supports. You can add or remove services 
here with a + or -, like -kdc.

You can further control access to your Samba service by specifying what hosts can access your service 
by using the hosts allow option.
