The fsck can take a substantial amount of time, depending on the size of your 
filesystemâ€”up to hours! These automated recoveries will generally work, but on occasion the repair tools 
will find a problem they cannot fix automatically.

If this happens for the root filesystem, on which the repair utilities are stored, you can try to use the 

systemd emergency target (systemctl emergency) or you will need to boot from your installation DVD or 
USB.
