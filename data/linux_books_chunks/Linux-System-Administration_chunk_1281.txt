Remember that by
default tar will restore the file in the current directory.

root@RHELv4u4:~# tar xvf /backup/etc.tar etc/resolv.conf
etc/resolv.conf
root@RHELv4u4:~# ls -l /etc/resolv.conf
-rw-r--r--  2 root root 40 May 12 12:05 /etc/resolv.conf
root@RHELv4u4:~# ls -l etc/resolv.conf
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 77 May 12 08:31 etc/resolv.conf
root@RHELv4u4:~#
