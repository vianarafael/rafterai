in the case of your own self-managed Ca, the clients with your root certificates are ones 
you install it on yourself.

Hence, when your web client attempts to validate certificates provided by your CA, for example, an 

error message is generated indicating that the client does not trust the CA. Other services may just refuse 
to connect altogether with a valid certificate.
