marks (?), as in the following examples:

# find /etc -name passwd
/etc/pam.d/passwd

# find /etc -iname '*passwd*'
/etc/pam.d/passwd
/etc/passwd-
/etc/passwd.OLD
/etc/passwd
/etc/MYPASSWD
/etc/security/opasswd

Using the -name option and no asterisks, the ﬁ rst example above lists any ﬁ les in the 
/etc directory that are named passwd exactly.
