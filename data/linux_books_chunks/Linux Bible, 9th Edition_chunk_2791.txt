The options to the systemctl command should 
look familiar.

Stopping a service with systemd
In the example that follows, the status of the cups daemon is checked and then stopped 
using the systemctl stop cups.service command:

# systemctl status cups.service
cups.service - CUPS Printing Service
    Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/cups.service; enabled)
    Active: active (running) since Mon, 30 Apr 2018 12:36:3...
  Main PID: 1315 (cupsd)
    CGroup: name=systemd:/system/cups.service
            1315 /usr/sbin/cupsd -f
# systemctl stop cups.service
# systemctl status cups.service
cups.service - CUPS Printing Service
    Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/cups.service; enabled)
    Active: inactive (dead) since Tue, 01 May 2018 04:43:4...
    Process: 1315 ExecStart=/usr/sbin/cupsd -f
 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
    CGroup: name=systemd:/system/cups.service

Notice that when the status is taken, after stopping the cups daemon, the service is 
 inactive (dead) but still considered enabled.
