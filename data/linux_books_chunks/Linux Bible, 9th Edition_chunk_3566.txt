An administrator of a Linux system that is conﬁ gured to share 
its ﬁ lesystems using NFS has to perform the following tasks to set up NFS: 

1. Set up the network. NFS is typically used on private LANs as opposed to public networks, 

such as the Internet.

2. Start the NFS service. Several service daemons need to start up and run to have a fully 
operational NFS service.
