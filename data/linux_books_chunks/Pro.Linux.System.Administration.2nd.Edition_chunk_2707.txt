We thus need to configure the firewall on the DHCP server host to accept packets 
to port 67 at any address.

$ sudo /sbin/iptables –t filter –A INPUT -p udp --dport 67 -j ACCEPT

We now have a DHCP server configuration that assigns specific reserved IP addresses to defined hosts 

and uses a different address range for other hosts.
