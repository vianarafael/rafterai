It is based on a distributed 
architecture and can store petabytes of searchable data.

Elasticsearch will store our log data from Logstash in an index. An index is a logical namespace for data. 

With Logstash, by default, we create an index for each dayâ€™s log data. An index is made up of documents, 
which are the equivalent of relational database rows.
