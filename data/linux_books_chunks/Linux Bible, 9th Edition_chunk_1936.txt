Other 
Linux systems reserve GIDs between 0 to 500 for administrative groups.

Here are some examples of creating a group account with the groupadd command:

# groupadd kings
# groupadd -g 1325 jokers

In the examples just shown, the group named kings is created with the next available 
group ID. After that, the group jokers is created using the 1325 group ID.
