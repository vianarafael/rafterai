We can see messages since the last system boot with the –b option.

$ sudo journalctl –p info –b

This can often still be a lot of messages, so we can further refine this with more specific time filters.

$ sudo journalctl -p info --since "2016-11-28 22:44:00" --until "2016-11-28 22:54:00"

Here we are displaying the logs at priority info for the last ten minutes. The times are in local time.
