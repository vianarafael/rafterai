Notice that the process ID (PID) is still 2490, which is the same as it was in the 
example for restarting the cups daemon because the process was not stopped and 
started in the reload process.

# initctl reload cups
# initctl status cups
cups start/running, process 2490

You need root privileges to stop and start services.
