The next paragraphs will explain how
to create and use partitions.

A  partition's  geometry  and  size  is  usually  defined  by  a  starting  and  ending  cylinder
(sometimes  by  sector).  Partitions  can  be  of  type  primary  (maximum  four),  extended
(maximum one) or logical (contained within the extended partition). Each partition has a
type  field  that  contains  a  code.
