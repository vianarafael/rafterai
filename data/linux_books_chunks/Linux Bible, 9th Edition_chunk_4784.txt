In the example that follows, this command is 
entered on a Linux Mint system.

# iptables -t filter -vnL
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)...

Note that on systems with firewalld enabled, there are many more iptables chains and 
rules listed by default than you might be used to on a system using iptables directly.
