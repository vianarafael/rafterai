For example, to add a directory called /getstuff/bin, add 
the following:

3

PATH=$PATH:/getstuff/bin ; export PATH

This example Ô¨Å rst reads all the current path directories into the new PATH ($PATH), 
adds the /getstuff/bin directory, and then exports the new PATH.

Some people add the current directory to their PATH by adding a directory identifi ed simply as a dot (.) as follows:

PATH=.:$PATH ; export PATH

This enables you to run commands in your current directory before evaluating any other command in the path (which 
people may be used to if they have used DOS).
