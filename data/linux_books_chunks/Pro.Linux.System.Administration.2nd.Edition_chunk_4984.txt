Selecting the Panel data source

Once we select the data source, the test data will disappear. You can click “select metric” and choose 

the origin of the metric you want to graph. We have selected “collectd_backup_example_com,” and then we 
can select the metrics we interested in. We will choose “load” out of the list. We then select all the metrics 
available (*) and then again (*).
