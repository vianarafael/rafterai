This host has low swap space, and 

the CPU spends most of its time idle.

Disk Access
The vmstat utility will also give us information on how much data is being read from and written to disk. 
We’ve highlighted the bi (blocks in) and bo (blocks out) columns in the io group in Figure 17-4. By passing a 
second number as a parameter, we’ve told vmstat to quit after five intervals.
