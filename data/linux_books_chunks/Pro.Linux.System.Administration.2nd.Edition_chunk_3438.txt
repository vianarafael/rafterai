These real-
time blackhole lists (RBLs) will allow you to query their databases of known open relays and bad to and from 
addresses.

The reject_rbl_client queries the DNS block list (DNSBL) at zen.spamhaus.org and rejects any 
positive entries there. The reject_rhsbl_reverse_client queries dbl.spamhaus.org based on the client, 
which is a domain block list (DBLs).
