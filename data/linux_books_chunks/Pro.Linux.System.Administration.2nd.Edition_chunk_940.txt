Using sudo Authorization on Multiple Hosts

ataylor au-mel-centos-1=/bin/userdel,/bin/useradd
ataylor au-syd-ubuntu-1=ALL

In Listing 5-19, the user ataylor is allowed to use only the userdel and useradd commands on the host 

au-mel-centos-1, but on the host au-syd-ubuntu-1, she is allowed to use all commands as represented by 
the ALL option.

 â–  Caution 
the ALL variable allows no granularity of authorization configuration.

 You should be careful when using the ALL variable to define access to all commands on a host.
