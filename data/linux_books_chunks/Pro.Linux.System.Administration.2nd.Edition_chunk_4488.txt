We 
need to be on our DNS server and issue the following command:

$ sudo nsupdate -k /etc/bind/ddns_update.key
> server localhost
> update add ldap.example.com 8600 CNAME headoffice.example.com
> send
> quit
$ host ldap.example.com
ldap.example.com is an alias for headoffice.example.com.
headoffice.example.com has address 192.168.0.1

Since this points to an internal private IPv4 address, we will not be able to use Letâ€™s Encrypt to create 

our TLS certificate and will have to use our own private CA.
