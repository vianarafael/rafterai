Now the TCP 
Connect scan is attempted on Host-A’s ports from Host-B’s command line.

$ nmap -sT 10.140.67.23
Starting Nmap 5.21 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2015-03-22 05:34 HADT

Note: Host seems down. If it is really up,
 but blocking our ping probes, try -PN

Nmap done: 1 IP address (0 hosts up) scanned in 0.11 seconds

Here, nmap gives a helpful hint.
