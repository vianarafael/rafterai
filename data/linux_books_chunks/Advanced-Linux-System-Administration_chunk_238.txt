Unlike 
earlier versions, the NFS version 4 protocol supports traditional file access 
while integrating support for file locking and the mount protocol

[...]

The NFS version 4 protocol [...] retains the essential characteristics of 
previous versions: design for easy recovery, independent of transport protocols, 
operating systems and filesystems, simplicity, and good performance‚Äù (RFC3010)

The NFS server runs the following daemons:

rpc.nfsd
rpc.mountd

These services are started with the nfs sevice:

/etc/init.d/nfs start/stop/status/restart/reload

In addition rpc.statd is used to notify the client when the NFS service is unexpectedly 
interrupted, and rpc.lockd allows clients to lock files accessed on the server.

These services are started with the nfslock service:

/etc/init.d/nfslock start/stop/status/restart

Programs using remote procedure calls (RPC) use specific program numbers listed in 
/etc/rpc.
