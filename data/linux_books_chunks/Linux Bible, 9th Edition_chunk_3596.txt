Here’s an example of an /etc/exports ﬁ le:

/cal    *.linuxtoys.net(rw)              # Company events
/pub    *(ro,insecure,all_squash)        # Public dir
/home   maple(rw,root_squash) spruce(rw,root_squash)

The /cal entry represents a directory that contains information about events related to 
the company. Any computer in the company’s domain (*.linuxtoys.net) can mount 
that NFS share.
