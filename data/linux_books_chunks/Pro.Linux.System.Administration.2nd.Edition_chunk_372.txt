the boxes hosted by hashiCorp on atlas are created by community members 
or organizations and vary widely in design and purpose.

The Ubuntu team regularly pushes an official Vagrant box for public download. We shall use that as our 
Vagrant box. These Vagrant boxes are “base” images. You download them and use them as the basis for your 
own boxes.
