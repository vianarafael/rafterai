As you may have 
already worked out, our Loglevel of 480 comprises the level 32 (search filter), 64 (configuration processing), 
128 (access control list processing), and 256 (connections and LDAP operations results). This is a good 
setting while we are setting up our LDAP service, as it provides a nice level of information.
