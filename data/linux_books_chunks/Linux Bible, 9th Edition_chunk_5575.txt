If the Program 
does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any 
version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program speciﬁ es that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General 
Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version perma-
nently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
