The “System Libraries” of 
an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included 
in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major 
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to 
implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in 
source code form.
