For example, to have the 
 permissions of a user named jsmith, you’d type the following:

$ su - jsmith

Even if you were root user before you typed this command, afterward you would have 
only the permissions to open ﬁ les and run programs that are available to jsmith. As root 
user, however, after you type the su command to become another user, you don’t need a 
 password to continue.
