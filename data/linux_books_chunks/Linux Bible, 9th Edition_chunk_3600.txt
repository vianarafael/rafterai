Suppose, for example, that you are sharing /home from a computer named oak. 
The computers named maple and spruce could each mount that directory on their own
/home directories. If you gave all users the same username/UID on all machines, you could 
have the same /home/user directory available for each user, regardless of which computer 
he or she is logged into.
