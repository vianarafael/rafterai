Other options are try, which means the connection will continue if no 
certificate is provided, but if a bad certificate is provided, the connection is stopped immediately; allow, 
which means that if the certificate provided is bad, the session can continue anyway; and never, which 
means your host will not request or check the server certificate before establishing the connection.
