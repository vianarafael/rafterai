After you enter your password, the sudo command gives you a grace period during 
which you are not prompted for your password. This period is 5 minutes on CentOS and 15 minutes on 
Ubuntu. After this period, you will again be prompted for your password when you next run the sudo 
command.

On Ubuntu and CentOS, the sudo command is installed by default.
