The sync option will write writes to disk before completing the client request.

paul@laika:~$ cat /etc/exports 
# Everyone can read this share
/mnt/data/iso  *(ro)

# Only the computers barry and pasha can readwrite this one
/var/www pasha(rw) barry(rw)

# same, but without root squashing for barry
/var/ftp pasha(rw) barry(rw,no_root_squash)

# everyone from the netsec.lan domain gets access
/var/backup       *.netsec.lan(rw)

# ro for one network, rw for the other
/var/upload   192.168.1.0/24(ro) 192.168.5.0/24(rw)

You don't need to restart the nfs server to start exporting your newly created exports.
