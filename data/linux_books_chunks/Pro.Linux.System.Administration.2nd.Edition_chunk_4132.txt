We will leave this as is.

The FileSet = "Linux" directive defines the resource that describes the files we want to back up 
for our hosts. The FileSet will be defined later in our Director configuration file. In the FileSet, you can 
include and exclude directories and file names or types. You can also define Linux, Microsoft Windows, or 
Mac files to be backed up or excluded.
