You can remove the quiet option 
from the conﬁ guration ﬁ le setting so that when a user has had too many failed attempts to 
log in, he or she receives a message such as “Account locked due to 4 failed logins.”

On Ubuntu, instead of the system-auth confi guration fi le, you need to add the auth context information to the 
/etc/pam.d/common-auth fi le and add the account context information to the /etc/pam.d/ common-
account fi le.

The pam_tally2 module also includes a command line interface that you can use to 
monitor login failure attempts.
