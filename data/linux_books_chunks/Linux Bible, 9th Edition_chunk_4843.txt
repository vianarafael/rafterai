Because hypervisors tend to be commodity items (dozens or 
hundreds of hypervisors may be set up for a location), Linux is the logical choice as the 
 operating system running as hypervisors directly on hardware.

Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is the basic virtualization technology implemented to 
make a Linux system into a hypervisor.
