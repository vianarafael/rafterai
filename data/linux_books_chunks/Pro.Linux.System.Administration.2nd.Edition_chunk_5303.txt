Inside the definition are the attributes 
of the object defined by a series of key/value statements, separated by spaces. Our host object definition has 
four attributes: use, host_name, alias, and address.

 Some attributes are mandatory for certain object definitions, meaning you must specify the attribute 

 â–  Tip 
and a value for them.
