For example, you can see that the ﬁ le system-auth is  actually 
a symbolic link pointing to the ﬁ le system-auth-ac. The ﬁ rst character in the ﬁ le’s 
 security is an l. This indicates that the ﬁ le is linked. The -> symbol shows that the ﬁ le is 
symbolically linked.

# ls -l system-auth
lrwxrwxrwx.
