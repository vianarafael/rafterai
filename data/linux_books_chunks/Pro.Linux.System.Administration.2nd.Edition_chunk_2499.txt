Simple recursive DNS query

The local dns server will first need to ask the ‘.’ root servers for a server that can answer for the ‘.com.’ 

zone. The local dns server will then ask one of the ‘.com.’ servers which server can answer queries for  
‘‘.google.com.’. We then query one of the nsX.google.com. servers for the ‘www’ record.
