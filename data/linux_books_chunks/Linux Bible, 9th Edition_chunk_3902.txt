Hereâ€™s an example of what the crontab fi le you create might look like:

#  min  hour  day/month  month  day/week  command
   59   23    *          *      *         yum -y update | mail root@localhost

A crontab fi le consists of fi ve fi elds, designating day and time, and a sixth fi eld, containing the com-
mand line to run. I added the comment line to indicate the fi elds.
