Here are some examples of man commands and options:

$ man -k passwd
...
passwd               (1)  - update user's authentication tokens
passwd               (5)  - password file
$ man passwd
$ man 5 passwd

Using the -k option, you can search the name and summary sections of all man pages 
installed on the system. About a dozen man pages include “passwd” in the name or 
description of a command.
