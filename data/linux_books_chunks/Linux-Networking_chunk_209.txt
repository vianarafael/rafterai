dhclient

Home and client Linux desktops often have /sbin/dhclient running. This is a daemon that
enables a network interface to lease an ip configuration from a dhcp server. When your
adapter is configured for dhcp or bootp, then /sbin/ifup will start the dhclient daemon.

When a lease is renewed, dhclient will override your ifconfig set ip address!
