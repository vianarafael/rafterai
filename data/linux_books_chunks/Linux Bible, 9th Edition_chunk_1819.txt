For example:

# rpm -Fhv *.rpm

You could use the previous freshen command if you were in a directory containing  thousands 
of RPMs but only wanted to update those that were already installed (in an earlier version) on 
your system and skip those that were not yet installed.You can add a few  interesting options 
to any of your install options.
