Let’s now take a look at 
where we will store our log data, namely, Elasticsearch.

Elasticsearch is an Apache Lucene–based full-text search and analytics engine. (Lucene is a code 
library and API: http://lucene.apache.org/core/.) Elasticsearch is great at searching and making sense 
of text-based data. It has a RESTful API that allows you to query and store data.
