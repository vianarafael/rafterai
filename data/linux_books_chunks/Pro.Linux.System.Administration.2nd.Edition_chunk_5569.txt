It takes the following form:

<owner> <question name> <question type> <value>

So something like setting the locale for your system would look something like this:

d-i debian-installer/locale string en

The owner is the debian-installer, the question is debian-installer/locale, the type is string, and 

the value is en, or English.

Installation Source

Cobbler is selected as the initial installation source via the live-installer question.

d-i live-installer/net-image string http://$http_server/cobbler/links/$distro_name/install/
filesystem.squashfs

During the install, you can set up your apt repositories.
