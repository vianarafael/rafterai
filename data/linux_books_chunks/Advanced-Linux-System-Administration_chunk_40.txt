If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and 
contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as 
invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
