Commands that run as daemon processes are also contained in this 
 directory. Daemon processes are processes that run in the background,  waiting 
for service requests such as those to access a printer or a web page. (Look for 
 commands that end in d, such as sshd, pppd, and cupsd.)

The /sbin and /usr/sbin directories are still used in Ubuntu as described here.
