Directories inherit settings from directories above them, with the most speciﬁ c 
Directory block overriding less-speciﬁ c ones, regardless of the order in which 
they appear in the conﬁ guration ﬁ les.

 ■ Files tags are used to specify ﬁ les by name. Files tags can be contained within 
Directory blocks to limit them to ﬁ les under that directory.
