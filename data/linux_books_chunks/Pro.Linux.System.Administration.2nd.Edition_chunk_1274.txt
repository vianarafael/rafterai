each address 
character you see is actually 4 bits. Meaning that the first character(f) in this local link address 
fe80::a00:27ff:fea4:da6b/64 is actually 1111 in binary. each set of four characters represents 16 
bits (4x4 bits) which is in total 80 bits. the full iPv6 address is 128 bits. An iSP will usually hand out 
a /48 address space depending on your requirements.
