Moving running VMs can be useful if a hypervisor becomes overloaded or 
needs to shut down for maintenance.

The setup we build during this procedure allows you to work with virtual machines in the 
following ways:

 ■ Install a new virtual machine on a hypervisor

 ■ Set features on your virtual machines

 ■ Log in to and use a virtual machine running on a hypervisor

 ■ Migrate a running virtual machine to another hypervisor

The technologies we explore here include: 

 ■ Kernel Virtualization Module (KVM)—KVM is the basic kernel technology that 

allows virtual machines to interact with the Linux Kernel.

 ■ QEMU Processor Emulator—One qemu process runs for each active virtual machine 
on the system.
