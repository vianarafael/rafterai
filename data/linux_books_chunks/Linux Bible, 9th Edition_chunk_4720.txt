So another nmap scan is attempted from Host-B, using nmap’s advice of disabling 
the scan’s ping probes via the -PN option.

$ nmap -sT -PN 10.140.67.23
Starting Nmap 5.21 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2016-03-22 05:55 HADT

Nmap scan report for 10.140.67.23

Host is up (0.0015s latency).
All 1000 scanned ports on 10.140.67.23 are filtered

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 5.54 seconds

You can see that Host-A (10.140.67.23) is up and running and all its ports have a status of 
filtered.
