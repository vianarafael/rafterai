The following are files we want to exclude:

- /data/
- /dev/
- /lost+found/
- /media/
- /mnt/
- /proc/
- /run/
- /srv/
- /sys/
- /tmp/
- /var/tmp

By default, all files are included under the / directory as determined by the SOURCE='/' configuration in 
our Duply conf file. This example shows we are going to exclude all the normal system directories, like /dev, 
/proc, and /sys.
