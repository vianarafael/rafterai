Then FPM via the gem command:

$ sudo gem install fpm

We now create a temporary installation directory to hold our nginx installation.

$ sudo mkdir /tmp/installdir

Then we go to our nginx source directory where we compiled our nginx source, in Listing 8-25, and now 

issue the following command to install nginx into our temporary install directory.

$ sudo make install DESTDIR=/tmp/installdir

If you view the /tmp/installdir directory you will see we have now installed our nginx in that 

directory.
