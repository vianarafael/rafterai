Most shells are highly 
customizable, and many users eventually tweak every aspect of their shell environment to help them work 
faster and more efficiently.

The Bash shell reads its initial configuration from the /etc/profile file. This file usually contains 
references to other global configuration files and is used to configure Bash for all users on the host except the 
root user.
