All processes that can be 
started or stopped at a given runlevel are controlled by a script (called an “init script” or an 
“rc script”) in /etc/rc.d/init.d

Selecting a process to run or be stopped in a given runlevel is done by creating symbolic

links in the  /etc/rc.d/rcN.d/ directory, where N is a runlevel.

Example 1: selecting httpd process for runlevel 3:

ln -s  /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S85httpd

Notice that the name of the link is the same as the name of the process and is preceded 
by an S for start and a number representing the order of execution.

Example 2: stopping httpd process for runlevel 3:

rm /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S85httpd

ln -s  /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/K15httpd

This time the name of the link starts with a K for kill to make sure the process is stopped 
when switching from one runlevel to another.
