Adding Zone Definitions

zone "example.com" {
    type master;
    file "master/example.com.db";
};

zone "0.168.192.in-addr.arpa" {
    type master;
    file "master/192.168.0.db";
};

Then we save the file and quit the editor. We need to tell the server to reload its configuration, either by 
restarting the server via systemctl reload or service, or using the rndc utility.
