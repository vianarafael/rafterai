To make sure that the information in your /boot directory is 
 accessible to the BIOS, create a separate disk partition (of about 500MB) for 
/boot. Even with several kernels installed, there is rarely a reason for /boot 
to be larger than 500MB.

This directory structure contains most of the applications and utilities available to 
Linux users.
