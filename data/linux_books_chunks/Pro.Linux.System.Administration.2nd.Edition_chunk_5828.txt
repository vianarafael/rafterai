If we donâ€™t add it, we will see an error like 
this when we run our playbook.

TASK [create db user bareos] ***************************************************
fatal: [backup.example.com]: FAILED! => {"failed": true, "msg": "ERROR! 'backup_database_
password' is undefined"}

So, we will add backup.example.com to the [dbs] host group in the /etc/ansible/hosts file.

[dbs]
db.example.com ansible_user=vagrant
backup.example.com

A host can be part of more than one group, and this will enable Ansible to see the vars for that host 

group.
