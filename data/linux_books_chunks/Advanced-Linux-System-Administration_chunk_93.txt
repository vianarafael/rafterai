So that

--- linux-2.4.21/arch/arm/def-configs/adsagc     
+++ linux-2.4.22/arch/arm/def-configs/adsagc

becomes

--- ./arch/arm/def-configs/adsagc     
+++ ./arch/arm/def-configs/adsagc

This is done with the -p1 option of patch effectively telling it to strip the first directory.

cd /usr/src/linux-2.4.21

zcat patch-2.4.22.gz | patch -p1

Testing the Patch

Before applying a patch one can test what will be changed without making them:

patch -p1 â€“dry-run  < patchfile

Recovering the Old Source Tree

The patch tool has several mechanisms to reverse the effect of a patch.

In all cases, make sure the old configuration (.config file) is saved.
