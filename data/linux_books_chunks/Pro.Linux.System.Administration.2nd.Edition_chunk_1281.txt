CHAPter 7 ■ NetworkiNg AND FirewAllS

Here we can concentrate on building the principal servers for our office, gateway.example.com and 

headoffice.example.com.

We will show you how to set up a PPPoE connection on the gateway.example.com host to act as a 

firewall/router host to our ISP and the Internet.

 ■ Note 

 PPPoe is a method used for connecting from ADSl modems to the internet.

Our main host, headoffice.example.com, will serve mail, web, and DNS services to the public (as we 

will show you in Chapters 10, 11, and 12).

We will use our gateway.example.com firewall host to accept and route traffic from the Internet through 

our internal network to our main host.
