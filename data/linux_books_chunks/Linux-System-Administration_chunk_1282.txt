And you can exclude directories or file
with --exclude.

root ~# tar cpzf /backup/etc_with_perms.tgz /etc

root ~# tar cpzf /backup/etc_no_sysconf.tgz /etc --exclude /etc/sysconfig
root ~# ls -l /backup/etc_*
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 8434293 May 12 12:48 /backup/etc_no_sysconf.tgz
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 8496591 May 12 12:48 /backup/etc_with_perms.tgz
root ~# 

You can also create a text file with names of files and directories to archive, and then supply
this file to tar with the -T flag.

root@RHELv4u4:~# find /etc -name *.conf > files_to_archive.txt
root@RHELv4u4:~# find /home -name *.pdf >> files_to_archive.txt
root@RHELv4u4:~# tar cpzf /backup/backup.tgz -T files_to_archive.txt 

The tar utility can receive filenames from the find command, with the help of xargs.

find /etc -type f -name "*.conf" | xargs tar czf /backup/confs.tar.gz

You can also use tar to copy a directory, this is more efficient than using cp -r.

(cd /etc; tar -cf - .
