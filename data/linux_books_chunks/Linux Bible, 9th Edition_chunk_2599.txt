To do that, create a /etc/modprobe.d/bonding.conf ﬁ le that contains the 
following entry:

alias bond0 bonding

Because all the interfaces are set to ONBOOT=yes, the bond0 interface starts and all the 
eth? interfaces are available as they are needed.

Setting custom routes
On a simple network conﬁ guration, communications that are destined for the local network 
are directed to the appropriate interface on your LAN, while communications for hosts out-
side your LAN go to a default gateway to be sent on to remote hosts.
