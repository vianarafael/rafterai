We need now to make some similar filesystem changes like 
we did for the remote service.

First we need to give access to the state file that keeps track of what journals we have sent and give 

access to the journal logs that are stored in /run/log/journal.

$ sudo chown systemd-journal-upload /var/lib/systemd/journal-upload
$ sudo usermod â€“aG systemd-journal systemd-journal-upload

We are now ready to start our journal uploader.

$ sudo systemctl enable systemd-journal-upload
$ sudo systemctl start systemd-journal-upload

We should, very shortly, start seeing logs coming into the /var/log/journal/remote directory on the 

backup.example.com host.

[jsmith@backup ~]$ sudo ls -l /var/log/journal/remote/
total 16388
-rw-r-----.
