The original meaning 

of this runlevel has been lost. Early UNIX systems used this runlevel to start tty 
 processes for systems where there were multiple dumb terminals connected to the 
system for people to use. This allowed many people to access a system simultane-
ously from character-based terminals (lots of people working from a shell with 
no graphical interface).
