To allow access to the administra-
tion tool, CUPS must be conÔ¨Å gured to prompt for a password (AuthType Basic).

Starting the CUPS server
For Linux systems that use SystemV-style startup scripts (such as earlier releases of Fedora 
and RHEL), starting and shutting down the CUPS print service is pretty easy. Use the 
 chkconfig command to turn on CUPS so it starts at each reboot.
