Kickstart 

and Preseed files may have different disk configurations or package lists that are tailored for particular 
profiles. To add a particular Kickstart or Preseed file, you first copy and modify any existing one to the way 
you like it and add it to the /var/lib/cobbler/kickstarts directory.
