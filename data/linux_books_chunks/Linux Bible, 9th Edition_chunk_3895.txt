With the 
rpmfusion.org repository enabled, your system should pick up the new drivers 
when the new kernel is added.

As an alternative to sites such as rpmfusion.org, you can go straight to the 
 website for the manufacturer and try to download their Linux drivers (Nvidia offers 
Linux drivers for its video cards), or if source code is available for the driver, you 
can try to build it yourself.
