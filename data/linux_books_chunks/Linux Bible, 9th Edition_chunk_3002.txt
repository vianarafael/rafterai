Document ﬁ les can be either added to the 
end of the lpr command line or directed to the lpr command using a pipe (|). Here’s an 
example of a simple lpr command:

$ lpr doc1.ps

When you specify just a document ﬁ le with lpr, output is directed to the default printer. 
As an individual user, you can change the default printer by setting the value of the 
PRINTER variable.
