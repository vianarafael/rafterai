that is a public key signing key (also a DnsKeY) and a private key signing key. We 
create a rrset of the DnsKeYs and use the private key signing key to sign them. this produces another 
rrsIG. In this way the public key signing key can be used to validate the public zone signing key.

at this stage we can validate the rrset and or public DnsKeYs.
