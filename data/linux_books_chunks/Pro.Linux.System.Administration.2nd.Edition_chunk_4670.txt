Again, we can create a new LDIF text file for our groups.

dn: ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com
objectclass: top
objectclass: organizationalUnit
ou: groups

You can see that creating the organizational unit for groups is similar to the way we declared the people 
organizational unit earlier. As required by the schema definition, we have used and declared the ou attribute 
to name our DN.
