This command opens a line above the current line 

and puts you in insert mode.

When you are in insert mode, -- INSERT -- appears at the bottom of the screen.

Type a few words, and press Enter. Repeat that a few times until you have a few lines of 
text. When you’re ﬁ nished typing, press Esc to return to command mode.
