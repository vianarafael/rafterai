Or they may allow access only to up to 30 percent of the total 
 processing power of a machine.

The types of resources that can be limited by cgroups include the following:

 ■ Storage (blkio)—Limits total input and output access to storage devices (such 

as hard disks, USB drives, and so on).

 ■ Processor scheduling (cpu)—Assigns the amount of access a cgroup has to 

be scheduled for processing power.

 ■ Process accounting (cpuacct)—Reports on CPU usage.
