This section describes a few solutions  corresponding to problems that can occur 
at the following stages of the booting process

Booting Stage 

Type of error 

INIT 

corrupt root filesystem or a 
faulty /etc/fstab entry 

Suggested Solution   

use root login prompt  

a kernel module  fails to 
load or an RC script fails 

override INIT (see below p.23) or use 
alternative runlevel 

KERNEL 

Kernel panic

(see below p.24) 

Hardware initialisation 
errors (often with older 
kernels on latest mother 
boards)

Pass appropriate bootloader 
parameter  - e.g acpi=off.
