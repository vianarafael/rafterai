So you search the 

system to see if any commands have had their ownership or permissions changed in 
the past three days:

$ find /bin /usr/bin /sbin /usr/sbin -ctime -3

 ■ You want to ﬁ nd ﬁ les in your FTP server (/var/ftp) and web server (/var/www) 
that have not been accessed in more than 300 days, so you can see if any need to 
be deleted:

$ find /var/ftp /var/www -atime +300

As you can glean from the examples, you can search for content or metadata changes over a 
certain number of days or minutes.
