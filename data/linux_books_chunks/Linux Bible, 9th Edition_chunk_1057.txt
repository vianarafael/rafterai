With top, the default is to display processes based on how much CPU time 
they are currently consuming. However, you can sort by other columns as well. After you 
identify a misbehaving process, you can also use top to kill (completely end) or renice 
(reprioritize) that process.

If you want to be able to kill or renice processes, you need to run top as the root user.
