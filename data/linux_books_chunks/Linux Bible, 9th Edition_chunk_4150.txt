options with the /var partition as you do for /home:

 ■ nosuid

 ■ nodev

Chapter 22: Understanding Basic Linux Security 

Putting the preceding into your /etc/fstab would look similar to the following:

/dev/sdb1    /home   ext4    nodev,noexec,nosuid   1 2
/dev/sdc1    /tmp    ext4    nodev,noexec,nosuid   1 1
/dev/sdb2    /usr    ext4    nodev                 1 2
/dev/sdb3    /var    ext4    nodev,noexec,nosuid   1 2

These mount options will help to further lock down your ﬁ lesystem and add another layer 
of protection from those with malicious intent.

Again, managing the various ﬁ le permissions and fstab options should be part of your 
security policy.
