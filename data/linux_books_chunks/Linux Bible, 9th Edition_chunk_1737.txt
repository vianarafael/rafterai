So if a  package 
being installed from rpmfusion.org needed a library or command from the main Fedora 
repository, the Fedora package could be downloaded and installed at the same time you 
install the rpmfusion.org package.

The yum repositories could be put in a directory on a web server (http://), an FTP server 
(ftp://), or a local medium such as a CD, DVD, or local directory (file://).
