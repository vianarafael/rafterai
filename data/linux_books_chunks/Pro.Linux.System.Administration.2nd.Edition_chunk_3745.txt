Now that we have added our credentials to the kernel, we can list the sales directory and read 
and write from and to it using the exbackup and sales group permissions.

[jsmith@backup ~]$ ll /data/sales/
total 1405408
-rwxrwx---+ 1 exbackup 3000017     66376 Nov 26 17:14 logo.png
-rwxrwx---+ 1 exbackup 3000017 479678976 Nov 27 13:21 forecast-2016.xls
-rwxrwx---+ 1 exbackup 3000017 479678976 Nov 27 14:04 media.docx

Now, bsingh also needs to access to the sales directory.
