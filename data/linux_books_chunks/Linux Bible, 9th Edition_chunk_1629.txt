The boot loader that is installed by 
default with Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems is the GRand Uniﬁ ed Boot loader (GRUB).

the following features:

 ■ Support for multiple executable formats.

 ■ Support for multi-boot operating systems (such as Fedora, RHEL, FreeBSD, NetBSD, 

OpenBSD, and other Linux systems).

 ■ Support for non-multi-boot operating systems (such as Windows 95, Windows 98, 
Windows NT, Windows ME, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and OS/2) via 
a chain-loading function.
