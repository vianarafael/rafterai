The following example demonstrates using the 
chkconfig command to disable the cups service at runlevel 5.

# chkconfig --level 5 cups off
# chkconfig --list cups
cups            0:off  1:off  2:on   3:on   4:on   5:off   6:off
# ls /etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S*cups
ls: cannot access /etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S*cups: No such file or directory

As expected, there is now no symbolic link, starting with the letter S, for the cups service 
in the /etc/rc.d/rc5.d directory.
