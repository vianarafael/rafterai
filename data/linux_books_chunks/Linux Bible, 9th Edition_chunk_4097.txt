It can become tiresome to come up with new, strong passwords every 30 days! That is why 
some enforcing techniques are often necessary.

If users are having a diffi cult time creating secure and unique passwords, consider installing the pwgen utility on your 
Linux system. This open source password generating utility creates passwords that are made to be pronounceable 
and memorable.
