You will see the word -- INSERT -- appear at the bottom of the screen. This means you’re in 
insert mode, which allows you to add to the file. You can now type in the file. Let’s type in hello jsmith. You 
can also use the arrow keys to move around on the line and through the file. The Enter key can be used to 
add lines to the file.

 You can use the touch command to create empty files.
