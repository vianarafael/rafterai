To check 
the state of SELinux on your system, type the following:

# getenforce
Enforcing
# grep ^SELINUX= /etc/sysconfig/selinux
SELINUX=enforcing

If your system is in Enforcing mode, as it is here, check the nfs_selinux man page 
for information about SELinux settings that can impact the operation of your vsftpd 
 service.
