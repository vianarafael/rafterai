curious smb.conf

Curious  but  true:  smb.conf  accepts  synonyms  like  create  mode  and  create  mask,  and
(sometimes) minor spelling errors like browsable and browseable. And on occasion you
can even switch words, the guest only parameter is identical to only guest. And writable
= yes is the same as readonly = no.
