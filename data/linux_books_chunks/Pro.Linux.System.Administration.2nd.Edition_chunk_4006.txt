Going to S3

From there we are going to create a bucket called our-backups. You are free to choose an appropriate 

name. Click the Create Bucket button to proceed.

As shown in Figure 14-3, we have created an S3 bucket called our-backups. We are next going to make 
sure that we have a life-cycle versioning policy on this bucket so that we don’t have to pay too much for any 
old data.
