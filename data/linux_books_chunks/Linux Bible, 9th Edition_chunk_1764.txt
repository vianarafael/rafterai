Before you do, you should understand 
that some third-party repositories have these limitations:

 ■ They may have less stringent requirements for redistribution and freedom from 

patent constraints than the Fedora and RHEL repositories have.

 ■ They may introduce some software conﬂ icts.

Chapter 10: Getting and Managing Software

 ■ They may include software that is not open source and, although it may be free for 

personal use, may not be redistributable.

 ■ They may slow down the process of installing all your packages (because metadata 

is downloaded for every repository you have enabled).

For those reasons, I recommend that you either don’t enable any extra software 
repositories, or enable only the RPM Fusion repository (http://rpmfusion.org) at ﬁ rst 
for Fedora and the EPEL repository (http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) for Red 
Hat Enterprise Linux.
