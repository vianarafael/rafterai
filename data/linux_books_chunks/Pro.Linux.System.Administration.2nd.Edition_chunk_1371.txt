The enp0s8 Slave Device Configuration

$ less  /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s8
DEVICE="enp0s8"
NAME="bond0-slave"
TYPE="Ethernet"
ONBOOT="yes"
BOOTPROTO="none"
SLAVE="yes"
MASTER="bond0"

This is a very simple configuration. We have specified the device we wish to control, enp0s8, and 

whether we would like it to initialize when we boot up our host by specifying ONBOOT=”yes”.
