To enlarge this physical group, block
devices (including partitions) can be added at a later time.

The size of lvm volumes on this physical group is independent of the individual size of the
components. The total size of the group is the limit.

One of the nice features of lvm is the logical volume resizing. You can increase the size of
an lvm volume, sometimes even without any downtime.
