Letâ€™s start with a simple rule..

sudo iptables -t filter -A IPV4-INCOMING -d 0.0.0.0/0 -s 0.0.0.0/0 -j ACCEPT
Chain IPV4-INCOMING (0 references)
num target   prot opt source  destination
1  ACCEPT   all -- anywhere anywhere

This rule allows all connections from anywhere on any port and is the equivalent of the ACCEPT policy.
