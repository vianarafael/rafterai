If you’re going to create your own CA, see the 

next section, “Creating Your Own Certificate Authority.”

Otherwise, you need to provide the contents of the www.example.com.csr file that you would provide 

to your commercial CA, and it will then deliver a certificate to you. Your commercial CA will provide 
instructions as to how to provide your CSR file.
