A snapshot Logical
Volume will retain a copy of all changed files of the snapshotted Logical Volume.

The example below creates a snapshot of the bigLV Logical Volume.

[root@RHEL5 ~]# lvcreate -L100M -s -n snapLV vg42/bigLV
  Logical volume "snapLV" created
[root@RHEL5 ~]#

You can see with lvs that the snapshot snapLV is indeed a snapshot of bigLV.
