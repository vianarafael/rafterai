In 
the example that follows, the ps -eZ command was used and then piped into grep to 
search for only processes running the bash shell.

# ps -eZ | grep bash
unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 1589 pts/
   0 00:00:00 bash
unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 5289 pts/
   1 00:00:00 bash
unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 5350 pts/
   1 00:00:00 bash

The process context list shows the following:

 ■ user—Process is mapped to the SELinux unconfined_u user.

 ■ role—Process is running as the unconfined_r role.

 ■ type—Process is running in the unconfined_t domain.

 ■ level—

 ■ sensitivity—Process has only level s0.

 ■ categories—Process has access to c0.c1023, which is all categories (c0 

through to c1023).

These security contexts can be changed to meet your organization’s particular security 
needs.
