I have removed comments and 
 rearranged some of the settings for clarity.

The following settings show locations where the httpd server is getting and putting 
 content by default:

ServerRoot "/etc/httpd"
Include conf.d/*.conf
ErrorLog logs/error_log
CustomLog "logs/access_log" combined
DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/var/www/cgi-bin/"

The ServerRoot directive identiﬁ es /etc/httpd as the location where conﬁ guration 
ﬁ les are stored.

At the point in the ﬁ le where the Include line appears, any ﬁ les ending in .conf from 
the /etc/httpd/conf.d directory are included in the httpd.conf ﬁ le.
