For example:

ADDRESS0=192.168.99.0
NETMASK0=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY0=192.168.0.5

In this example, any packet destined for a host on the 192.168.99 network would be 
sent through the local eth0 interface and directed to the gateway node at 192.168.0.5. 
Presumably, that node would provide a route to another network containing hosts in the 
192.168.99 address range.
