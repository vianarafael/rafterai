Usually, you can have as many argu-
ments as you want on the command line, limited only by the total number of characters 
allowed on a command line.

Sometimes, an argument is associated with an option. In that case, the argument must immedi-
ately follow the option. With single-letter options, the argument typically follows after a space.
