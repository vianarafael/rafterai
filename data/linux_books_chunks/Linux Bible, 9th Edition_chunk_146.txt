Then in the last few chapters, I demonstrate how you can try out Linux 
systems as hypervisors, cloud controllers, and virtual machines, as well as manage 
virtual networks and networked storage.

How This Book Is Organized
The book is organized to enable you to start off at the very beginning with Linux and grow

Linux is and get you started with a Linux desktop:

system is, where it comes from, and how to get started using it.

can create a desktop system and use some of the most popular desktop features.

Part II, “Becoming a Linux Power User,” provides in-depth details on how to use the Linux 
shell, work with ﬁ lesystems, manipulate text ﬁ les, manage processes, and use shell scripts:

 ■ Chapter 3, “Using the Shell,” includes information on how to access a shell, run 

commands, recall commands (using history), and do tab completion.
