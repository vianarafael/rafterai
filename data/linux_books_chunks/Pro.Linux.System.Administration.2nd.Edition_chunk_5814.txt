The copy module supports assigning owner, group, and mode permissions to the file we create. The path 
of src is relative to the playbooks directory.

In this simple playbook, we are not taking advantage of the templating engine that comes with Ansible. 

If you remember to Chapter 14 where we set up Bareos, we needed to add clients and passwords to our 
Bareos configuration files.
