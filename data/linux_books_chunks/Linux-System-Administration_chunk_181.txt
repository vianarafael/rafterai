renice

Since the processes are already running, we need to use the renice command to change their
nice value (NI).

The screenshot shows how to use renice on both the proj33 processes.

paul@ubuntu910:~$ renice +8 1670
1670: old priority 0, new priority 8
paul@ubuntu910:~$ renice +8 1671
1671: old priority 0, new priority 8

Normal users can attribute a nice value from zero to 20 to processes they own.
