To get the database to 
 contain all ﬁ les up to the current moment, you can simply run updatedb from 
the shell as root.

Here are some examples of using the locate command to search for ﬁ les:

$ locate .bashrc
/etc/skel/.bashrc
/home/cnegus/.bashrc
# locate .bashrc
/etc/skel/.bashrc
/home/bill/.bashrc
/home/joe/.bashrc
/root/.bashrc

When run as a regular user, locate only ﬁ nds .bashrc in /etc/skel and the user’s 
own home directory.
