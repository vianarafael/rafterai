This is quite new, and it currently has 
a few detractors since the TLS service isn’t really secure (doesn’t enforce client certificate verification), but it 
shows great promise as it matures.

The service can act either passively (wait for journal messages) or actively (pull messages from a remote 
host). It can be configured to listen over HTTP or HTTPS.
