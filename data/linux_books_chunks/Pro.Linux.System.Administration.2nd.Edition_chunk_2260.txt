This command is quick, as it simply queries the filesystem 
metadata. As you have seen you can also pass the mount path to only return the information for that mount.

$ df -h /data
Filesystem      Size  Used    Avail   Use%   Mounted on
/dev/sdb         16G   22M    14G     1%       /data

 â–  Note  to check the number of inodes, use the df -i command.
