Since it is impossible to accidentally 
remove packages without being the root user, running aptitude as a non-root user and becoming root only to 
apply pending changes is a good idea.

Rather than installing the package immediately, youâ€™ll see that the package status has changed from p 
to pi. It is now marked for installation.
