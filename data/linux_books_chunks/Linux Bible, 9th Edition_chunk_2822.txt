Remember that static means that the service is enabled by default and cannot be 
disabled, even by root.

Sometimes, disabling a service is not enough to make sure that it does not run. For 
 example, you might want network.service to replace NetworkManager.service for 
starting network interfaces on your system. Disabling NetworkManager would keep the 
 service from starting on its own.
