For example, if you want to install the Adobe Flash plug-in for Linux, 
download the YUM repository package from Adobe and you can use the yum command to 
install the Flash plug-in, and get updates later by running the yum update command, 
when updates are available.

Managing software with the YUM command
The yum command has dozens of subcommands you can use to work with RPM packages 
on your system.
