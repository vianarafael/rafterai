Normally, changes to environment variables change only the current session or script in which they are 
being made. In order to use them in other sessions or scripts, you need to export them. To make a path or 
other environmental change for all users, add the changes to the /etc/profile file or generally you would 
add those to a file in the /etc/profile.d/ directory.
