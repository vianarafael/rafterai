We do that by using the following ip link subcommand and then ip 
addr show enp0s8:

$ sudo ip link set dev enp0s8 up
...
3: enp0s8: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group 
default qlen 1000
    link/ether 08:00:27:13:3c:00 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet6 fe80::a00:27ff:fe13:3c00/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

Device enp0s8 now is UP and has been assigned a qdisc (pfifo_fast).
