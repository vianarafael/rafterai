We need to copy the data between the (). For our Bind DNS, we can add this as a multiline 
DNS record:

201609._domainkey IN TXT ("v=DKIM1 ; k=rsa, s=email; "
    "p= MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG ... "
    "XvcvE+wt6Q ... jasfQIDAQAB")

If you are using an external DNS provider, you may need to use multiline too (AWS Route53, for 
example). It is best to consult any of the documentation on DKIM.
