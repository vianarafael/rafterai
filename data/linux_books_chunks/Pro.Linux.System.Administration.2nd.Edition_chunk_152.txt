If one server 
doesn’t respond, your host will try the other server.

Every time your host goes to a web site, it uses both the default gateway and DNS server to find out how 

to get there. For example, if you type www.google.com in your browser’s address bar, your host will first find 
the DNS server, which may or may not be on your network.
