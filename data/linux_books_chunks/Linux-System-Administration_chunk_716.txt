The next
line is about what to do when the user hits Ctrl-Alt-Delete on the keyboard.

Here is what Debian 4.0 does.

root@barry:~# grep -i ctrl /etc/inittab 
# What to do when CTRL-ALT-DEL is pressed.
ca:12345:ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t1 -a -r now

Which is very similar to the default Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2 action.

[root@RHEL52 ~]# grep -i ctrl /etc/inittab 
# Trap CTRL-ALT-DELETE
ca::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t3 -r now

One noticable difference is that Debian forces shutdown to use /etc/shutdown.allow, where
Red Hat allows everyone to invoke shutdown pressing Ctrl-Alt-Delete.
