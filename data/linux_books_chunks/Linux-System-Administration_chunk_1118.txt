To avoid having to type this passphrase every time, you can add the key
to ssh-agent using ssh-add.

Most Linux distributions will start the ssh-agent automatically when you log on.

root@ubu1204~# ps -ef | grep ssh-agent
paul     2405  2365  0 08:13 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/ssh-agent...

This clipped screenshot shows how to use ssh-add to list the keys that are currently added
to the ssh-agent
