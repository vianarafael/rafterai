In Red Hat Enterprise Linux (up to RHEL 6) and in 
older Fedora distributions, you could type the following as root:

# chkconfig httpd on
# service httpd start
Starting httpd:                [  OK  ]

In recent Fedora systems and RHEL 7, you enable and start httpd using the systemctl 
command:

# systemctl enable httpd.service
# systemctl start httpd.service
# systemctl status httpd.service
httpd.service - The Apache HTTP Server

When the httpd service starts, six httpd daemon processes are launched by default to 
respond to requests for the web server.
