Logging to Multiple Places

auth                               /var/log/auth
auth.crit                         jsmith
auth.emerg                    /dev/console

Here all auth messages are logged to /var/log/auth as previously, but auth messages of crit or higher 

priority are also sent to user jsmith, if he is logged in.
