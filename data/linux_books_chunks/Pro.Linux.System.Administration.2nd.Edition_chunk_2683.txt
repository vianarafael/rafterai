Weâ€™ll start with options that 
define which address to use as the default route on our network and which host to use as the name server.

subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    option routers 192.168.0.254;
    option domain-name "example.com";
    option domain-name-servers 192.168.0.1;
    option broadcast-address 192.168.0.255;
}

Here we have defined which network settings should be sent to a client when it requests a lease.
