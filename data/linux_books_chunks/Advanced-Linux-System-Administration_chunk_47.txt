If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, 
make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original 
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section 
titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
