Or we might choose a granularity of 5 minutes for those metrics, and 1-second 
metrics are rolled up as 5-minute averages.

the next section.

<Plugin cpu>
    ReportByCpu true
    ReportByState true
    ValuesPercentage false
</Plugin>

When we declare our configuration options for our CPU, we are giving the options to report by CPU and 

report by state, and we are not showing values as percentages.
