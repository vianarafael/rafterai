Samba will create all the necessary DNS 
records required during the setup process. SAMBA_INTERNAL is also suitable if you want to let Samba own and 
manage your DNS setup. BIND9_FLATFILE is not a recommended option, and you should choose NONE if you 
want to completely manage your own DNS.

You will be asked to provide the administrator password.
