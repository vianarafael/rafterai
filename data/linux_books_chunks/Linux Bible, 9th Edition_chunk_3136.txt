Traditionally, you would place an index.html Ô¨Å le in the 
DocumentRoot directory (/var/www/html, by default) as the homepage and add other 
content as needed. The ScriptAlias directive tells the httpd daemon that any scripts 
requested from the cgi-bin directory should be found in the /var/www/cgi-bin direc-
tory.
