The default search domain is 
example.com, and any hostname searches will have that domain appended to the end of the query. Next, we 
have the nameserver(s) we wish to query for our domain name resolution. These should be in IP address 
format. If the first nameserver is unavailable, the second will be used.

The dig command will query these nameservers unless otherwise instructed.
