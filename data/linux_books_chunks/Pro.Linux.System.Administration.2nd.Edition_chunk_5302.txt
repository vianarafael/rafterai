A Host Object

define host {
        use                   linux-server    ; Name of host template to use
                                                        ; This host definition will inherit 

                                                        ; in (or inherited by) the linux-
server host template definition.

all variables that are defined

        host_name       localhost
        alias                 localhost
        address            127.0.0.1
        }

You can see that an object definition starts with define, the type of object to define (in our case a host 
object), and the definition, which is enclosed in the { } curly braces.
