Instead of the --list option, the --level option is used, as shown in the 
 following code:

# chkconfig --level 3 cups on
# chkconfig --list cups
cups            0:off  1:off  2:off  3:on   4:off  5:off  6:off
# ls /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S*cups
/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S56cups

The service’s persistence at runlevel 3 is veriﬁ ed by both using the chkconfig --list 
command and looking at the rc3.d directory for any ﬁ les starting with the letter S.

To make a service persistent on more than one runlevel, you can do the following:

# chkconfig --level 2345 cups on
# chkconfig --list cups
cups            0:off  1:off  2:on   3:on   4:on   5:on   6:off
# ls /etc/rc.d/rc?.d/S*cups
/etc/rc.d/rc2.d/S56cups  /etc/rc.d/rc4.d/S56cups
/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S56cups  /etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S56cups

Disabling a service is just as easy as enabling one with SysVinit.
