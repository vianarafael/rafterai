Using the Perl taint module to secure data

The taint module is used to check that external variables supplied by the user cannot be 
used to exploit the system. This module is automatically used when running scripts that have 
the setuid or setgid bit turned on. It is possible to force a perl script to switch the taint module 
on with the -T option.
