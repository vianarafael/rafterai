In our Storage 
file we have the following:

Storage {                             # definition of myself
  Name = example-sd
  Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 20

  # remove comment from "Plugin Directory" to load plugins from specified directory.
  # if "Plugin Names" is defined, only the specified plugins will be loaded,
  # otherwise all storage plugins (*-sd.so) from the "Plugin Directory".
  #
  # Plugin Directory = /usr/lib64/bareos/plugins
  # Plugin Names = ""
}

#
# List Directors who are permitted to contact Storage daemon
#
Director {
  Name = example-dir
  Password = "4ncvx7V+Mw4NOMDMyuYjCHsNg1nKgcdh8nl0szWpi6t4"
}

In the file /etc/bareos/bareos-sd.conf, we have defined the Name of our Storage daemon, example-sd.
