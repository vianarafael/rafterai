the apt-cache command searches 
package lists and displays package information. the apt-file command searches file content lists for 
which package provides a file.

the aptitude tool was written as a drop-in replacement for apt-get, so in all cases where you run 
aptitude noninteractively, you can replace it with apt-get.
