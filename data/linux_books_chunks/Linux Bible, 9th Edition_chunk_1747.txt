Checking /etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date (RHEL only)
For Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems, instead of pointing to a single public software  repository 
(as Fedora does), you register your system with Red Hat Network and purchase entitlements to 
download software from different channels.

When your system is registered with Red Hat Network, information is added to the /etc/
sysconfig/rhn/up2date ﬁ le to tell yum where to ﬁ nd Red Hat Enterprise Linux  packages 
(either from a hosted Red Hat Network or from an RHN Satellite server).
