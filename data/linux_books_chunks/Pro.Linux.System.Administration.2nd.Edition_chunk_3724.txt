We want to prevent general access to the directories 

and allow only defined users and groups.

$ sudo chmod 0750 /data && sudo chmod 2750 /data/staff 
&& sudo chmod 2770 –R /data/staff/sales

We are now ready to use our Samba service.

Required iptables Rules for Samba
Samba 4 requires the following ports to be open in your firewall:

•	 UDP protocol on ports 137 and 138 for NetBIOS name services

•	

•	

TCP protocol on port 139 for NetBIOS sessions

The Microsoft-dn TCP port 445 for the Samba server

For Ubuntu we just need to add the following commands:

$ sudo ufw allow samba
$ sudo ufw allow bind9

There are many ports that are listening with Samba.
