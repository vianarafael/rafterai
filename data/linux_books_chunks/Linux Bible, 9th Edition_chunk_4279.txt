 modern ciphers.

TABLE 23.1    Cryptography Ciphers

Method

Description

AES (Advanced 
Encryption Standard) 
also called Rijndael

Symmetric cryptography.

Block cipher, encrypting data in 128-, 192-, or 256-bit blocks using a 
128-, 192-, or 256-bit key for encrypting/decrypting.

Blowfi sh

Symmetric cryptography.

Block cipher, encrypting data in 64-bit blocks using the same 32-bit to 
448-bit keys for encrypting/decrypting.

Method

CAST5

Description

Symmetric cryptography.

Block cipher, encrypting data in 64-bit blocks using the same up to 
128-bit key for encrypting/decrypting.

DES (Data Encryption 
Standard)

No longer considered secure.

Symmetric cryptography.

Block cipher, encrypting data in 64-bit blocks using the same 56-bit 
key for encrypting/decrypting.

3DES

Improved DES cipher.

Symmetric cryptography.

Data is encrypted up to 48 times with 3 different 56-bit keys before 
the encryption process is completed.

El Gamal

Asymmetric cryptography.

Elliptic Curve 
Cryptosystems

Uses two keys derived from a logarithm algorithm.

Asymmetric cryptography.

Uses two keys derived from an algorithm containing two  randomly 
chosen points on an elliptic curve.

IDEA

Symmetric cryptography.

Block cipher, encrypting data in 64-bit blocks using the same  128-bit 
key for encrypting/decrypting.

RC4 also called 
ArcFour or ARC4

Stream cipher, encrypting data in 64-bit blocks using a variable key 
size for encrypting/decrypting.

RC5

RC6

Rijndael also called 
AES

Symmetric cryptography.

Block cipher, encrypting data in 32-, 64-, or 128-bit blocks using the 
same up to 2,048-bit keys for encrypting/decrypting.

Symmetric cryptography.

Same as RC5, but slightly faster.

Symmetric cryptography.

Block cipher, encrypting data in 128-, 192-, or 256-bit blocks using a 
128-, 192-, or 256-bit key for encrypting/decrypting.

RSA

Most popular asymmetric cryptography.

Uses two keys derived from an algorithm containing a multiple of two 
randomly generated prime numbers.

Understanding cryptographic cipher keys
Cryptographic ciphers require a piece of data, called a key, to complete their mathematical 
process of encryption/decryption.
