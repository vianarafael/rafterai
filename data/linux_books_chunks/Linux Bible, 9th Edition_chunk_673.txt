Another way to work with your history list is to use the fc command. Type fc followed 
by a history line number, and that command line is opened in a text editor (vi by default; 
type :wq to save and exit or :q! to just exit if you are stuck in vi). Make the changes that 
you want. When you exit the editor, the command runs.
