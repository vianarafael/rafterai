This is now available as a variable <%= $root_login %>.

When we now connect a client that applies the File['/etc/ssh/sshd_config'] resource, the value of 

the ipaddress fact on the client will be added to the template, and the root_login will be evaluated to no 
and then applied on the client in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.

You can perform a wide variety of functions in an EPP templateâ€”more than just specifying variables.
