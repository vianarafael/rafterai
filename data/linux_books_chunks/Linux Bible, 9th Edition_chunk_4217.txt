Therefore, Linux systems used for such purposes need to 
be scanned for Windows viruses as well.

Antivirus software scans ﬁ les using virus signatures. A virus signature is a hash created 
from a virus’s binary code. The hash will positively identify that virus. Antivirus programs 
have a virus signature database that is used to compare against ﬁ les to see if there is a sig-
nature match.
