The main 

server, headoffice.example.com with IP address 192.168.0.1, will be able to communicate to the branch 
offices via the VPN networks we will establish from that host to those remote branches (we will explain VPNs 
in Chapter 15).

The desktops in our local wired network have been given a pool of addresses to use in a range of 

192.168.0.101â€“192.168.0.200.
