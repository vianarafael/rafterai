For example, you could use */4 in the hour column, and the job would run every other 
minute every fourth hour, like so:

*/2 */4 1 * * root run-parts /etc/cron.monthly

The use of the comma indicates a list of values, for example

2 0,1,2,3,4 1 * * root run-parts /etc/cron.monthly

This would run the job at 12:02 a.m., 1:00 a.m., 2:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., and 4:00 a.m.
You can also specify ranges of numbers as follows:

2 0-4,12-16 1 * * root run-parts /etc/cron.monthly

Here the command would be run at 2 minutes past the hour between the hours of 12 a.m.
