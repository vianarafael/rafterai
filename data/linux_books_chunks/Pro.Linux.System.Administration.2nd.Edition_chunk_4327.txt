You can use this request again to create a new certificate, as we 
mentioned in Chapter 11.

We want to protect our certificate and key with the right ownership and some restricted permissions for 

our key.

$ sudo chown root:root /etc/pki/tls/{private,certs}/gateway.example.com.*
$ sudo chmod 0400 /etc//pki/tls/private/gateway.example.com.key

We also need to create some Diffie-Hellman parameters, cryptographic parameters that enhance 

the security of our VPN session.
