A dash (-) here indicates a regular file that might contain data or 
text, or be a binary executable. A d indicates a directory, which is essentially a file that lists other files. An l 
indicates a symbolic link. Symbolic links allow you to make files and directories visible in multiple locations 
in the filesystem.
