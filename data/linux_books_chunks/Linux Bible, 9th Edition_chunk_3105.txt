This ﬂ exibility comes at 
the cost of increased complexity in the form of a large number of conﬁ guration options 
(called directives). But in practice, you need to be familiar with only a few directives in 
most cases.

See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/directives.html for a complete list of 
directives supported by Apache.
