The option we have 
added here is how you can run your commands via a jump host, so any target hosts will be accessed via this 
SSH proxy server.

There is no ansible service to start. However, you may want to automate the process of running 
playbooks on your hosts; that is where Ansible Tower (https://www.ansible.com/tower) comes in.
