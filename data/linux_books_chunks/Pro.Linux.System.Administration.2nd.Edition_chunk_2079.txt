The RAID 

controller combines multiple disks into a Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID). Weâ€™ll talk more 
about RAID later on in this chapter. To find out what the device nodes for the RAID array are, you can list all 
block devices in the /dev/ directory with the following command:

$ ls -l /dev | grep ^b

This command will list only lines starting with b.
