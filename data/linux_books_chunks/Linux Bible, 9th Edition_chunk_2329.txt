You can also copy ﬁ les recursively 
through a whole directory structure, if you choose.

The following is an example of using the scp command to copy a ﬁ le called memo from 
the home directory of the user chris to the /tmp directory on a remote computer as the 
user johndoe:

$ scp /home/chris/memo johndoe@10.140.67.23:/tmp
johndoe@10.140.67.23's password: ***************
memo       100%|****************|  153   0:00

You must enter the password for johndoe.
