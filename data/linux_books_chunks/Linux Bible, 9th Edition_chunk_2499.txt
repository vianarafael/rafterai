A VPN provides a way to 
have encrypted, private communications between a client and a remote network over an 
insecure network (such as the Internet). Here, the tunnel goes from the local system over 
the wlan0 interface to a host named vpn.example.com (some of the name is truncated).

All communication to 192.168.0.0/24 network still goes directly over the wireless LAN.
