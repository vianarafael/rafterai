To see how the document really appeared, they would use a command 
such as the following:

$ gunzip < /usr/share/man/man1/grep.1.gz | nroff -c -man | less

In this example, the contents of the grep man page (grep.1.gz) are directed to the 
 gunzip command to be unzipped. The output from gunzip is piped to the nroff com-
mand to format the man page using the manual macro (-man).
