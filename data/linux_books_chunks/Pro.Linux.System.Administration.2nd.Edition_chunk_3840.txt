There is still clearly a need for file sharing, 
but a better way to manage the documents in your business exists.

A good document management system (DMS) will ideally achieve these five things for you:

•	

•	

•	

•	

Securely share your documents with other staff members

Provide version control for documents so that previous edits are not lost

Require documents to be checked out so that two people can’t edit the same 
document at the same time

Style the DMS to match your company’s workflow for creating, reviewing, and 
publishing documents

•	 Have a single entry point for all your document sharing without having to manage 

several file servers and their file shares

With a good document management system, you typically have a web portal that becomes the central 

point for all access to your documents.
