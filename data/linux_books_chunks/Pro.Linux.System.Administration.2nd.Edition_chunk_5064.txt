Both packages provide the systemd-journal-gateway, systemd-
journal-upload, and systemd-journal-remote services.

The gateway service is an HTTP server that can be used to query journal logs. The remote service is 
used to receive logs from other servers. The upload, of course, is used to upload logs to a remote server.
