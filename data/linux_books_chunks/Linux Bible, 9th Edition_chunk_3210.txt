Or, if you have multiple SSL hosts, you 
might want to create a separate entry (possibly in a separate .conf Ô¨Å le) that looks 
like the following:

Listen 192.168.0.56:443
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName      secure.example.org
    ServerAlias     web.example.org
    DocumentRoot    /home/username/public_html/
    DirectoryIndex  index.php index.html index.htm
    SSLEngine       On
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/server.key
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/example.org.crt
</VirtualHost>

The IP address shown in the Listen directive should be replaced by the public IP address 
representing the SSL host you are serving.
