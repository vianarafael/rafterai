To ﬁ nd out what your default 
login shell is, type the following commands:

$ who am i
chris   pts/0        2014-10-21 22:45 (:0.0)
$ grep chris /etc/passwd
chris:x:13597:13597:Chris Negus:/home/chris:/bin/bash

The who am i command shows your username, and the grep command (replacing chris 
with your name) shows the deﬁ nition of your user account in the /etc/password ﬁ le.
