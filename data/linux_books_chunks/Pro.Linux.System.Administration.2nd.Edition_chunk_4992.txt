The most common change you may make when tuning for 
resource limits is the number of open files a user can have.

You can obtain a full listing of options and their functions in the ulimit section of the man bash page.

Setting Limits for All Users

The ulimit command sets limits for the current shell, so you can add limits via /etc/profile or /
etc/bashrc for users who log in.
