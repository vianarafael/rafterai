The options to expand come down to adding new 
bricks to existing peers or adding new peers and bricks into the volume. We have added a new 50GB hard 
drive to our existing peers, and we are going to add them to the vol1 volume.

We are going to create another three 50GB drives and add them into the volume as another set.
