The next section describes how to conﬁ gure Samba, including how to iden-
tify which hosts, users, or network interfaces can access your Samba server.

Confi guring Samba
Most Samba conﬁ guration is done in the /etc/samba/smb.conf ﬁ le. As you conﬁ gure 
your Samba server, you can also add host information to the lmhosts ﬁ le.

To conﬁ gure smb.conf, you can use a plain-text editor.
