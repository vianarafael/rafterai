The status results of all the PAM modules are combined into a single overall result 

of authentication success or failure.

Typically, if a single PAM module returns a failure status, access to the application is 
denied. However, this is dependent upon the conﬁ guration ﬁ le settings.

Most PAM conﬁ guration ﬁ les are located in /etc/pam.d.
