joining an Active Directory domain

While the Samba server is stopped, you can use net rpc join to join the Active Directory
domain.

[root@RHEL52 samba]# service smb stop
Shutting down SMB services:                                [  OK  ]
Shutting down NMB services:                                [  OK  ]
[root@RHEL52 samba]# net rpc join -U Administrator
Password:
Joined domain STARGATE.

We can verify in the aduc (Active Directory Users and Computers) that a computer account
is created for this samba server.
