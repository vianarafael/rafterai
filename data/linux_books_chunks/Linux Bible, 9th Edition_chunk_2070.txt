The section following this 
describes how to partition a disk with multiple partitions.

If you make a mistake partitioning your disk with fdisk, just type q to exit without saving your changes. If you are 
stuck in the middle of an operation, such as adding a partition, just complete that operation, and then type q after 
you see the command prompt.
