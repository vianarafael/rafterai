These files (called the
quota files) contain the table of the disk usage on that file system. Use the quotacheck
command to accomplish this.

root@RHELv4u4:~# quotacheck -cug /home
root@RHELv4u4:~# quotacheck -avug

The -c is for create, u for user quota, g for group, a for checking all quota enabled file systems
in /etc/fstab and v for verbose information.
