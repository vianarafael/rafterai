Taking 

a look at carbon.conf you will see that we have a [cache] section that is similar to our carbon-cache 
configuration seen previously.

[cache]
STORAGE_DIR    = /var/lib/graphite/
LOCAL_DATA_DIR = /var/lib/graphite/whisper/
CONF_DIR       = /etc/carbon/
LOG_DIR        = /var/log/carbon/
PID_DIR        = /var/run/
ENABLE_LOGROTATION = False
USER = carbon
LOG_LISTENER_CONNECTIONS = True
USE_INSECURE_UNPICKLER = False
USE_FLOW_CONTROL = True
CACHE_WRITE_STRATEGY = sorted

Next we are going create a [relay] section.

[relay]
LINE_RECEIVER_INTERFACE = 0.0.0.0
PICKLE_RECEIVER_INTERFACE = 0.0.0.0
LINE_RECEIVER_PORT = 2013
PICKLE_RECEIVER_PORT = 2014
DESTINATIONS = monitor.example.com:2004
LOG_LISTENER_CONNECTIONS = True
RELAY_METHOD = rules
MAX_DATAPOINTS_PER_MESSAGE = 500
MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 10000
QUEUE_LOW_WATERMARK_PCT = 0.8
USE_FLOW_CONTROL = True

It has similar settings to a carbon-cache.
