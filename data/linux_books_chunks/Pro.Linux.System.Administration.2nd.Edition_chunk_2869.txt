In this one we have added some extra directives. 
We start by opening the VirtualHost tag and specifying that the definition will apply to all addresses. Next, 
we specify the names we want this virtual host to reply to. Only a single ServerName can apply to any given 
virtual host, but others can be added via ServerAlias.
