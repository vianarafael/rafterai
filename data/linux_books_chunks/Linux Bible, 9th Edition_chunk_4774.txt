After a network packet matches a particular 
rule or falls to the default policy, action on the packet can occur. The action taken 
depends upon what iptable target is set. Here are a couple of actions (targets) that 
can be taken:

 ■ ACCEPT—Network packet is accepted into the server.

 ■ REJECT—Network packet is dropped and not allowed into the server.
