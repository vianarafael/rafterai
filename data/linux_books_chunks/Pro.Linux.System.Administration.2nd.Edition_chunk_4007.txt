What this policy will do is to move to lower-cost storage after 35 days and delete any objects just 
older than one year. The reason is that if we havenâ€™t used the data after a month, the likelihood we will need 
it beyond that is small and so we will move it to a lower-cost tier of storage. We allow 5 days (30+5) after the 
month for a little buffer like we do at the expiration of 1 year.
