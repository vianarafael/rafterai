If a different program is listening to port 80, it is shown there. You can use the kill 
command to terminate the process, but if it is something other than httpd, you should 
also ﬁ nd out why it is running.

If you don’t see any other processes listening on port 80, it could be that you have 
 accidentally told Apache to listen on the same IP address and port combination in more 
than one place.
