Adding a route

Host A and Host C are properly configured to route between the networks. In their routing tables, they 
send all requests destined for other networks via their default gateway. In this case their default gateway is 
the firewall/router, and the address of their default gateway is 192.168.0.254 and 192.168.1.254, respectively.
