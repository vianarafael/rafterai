The second column, labeled VG, refers to the volume group, 
which is the next layer in the LVM system.

You can list all volume groups on the system via the vgs command.

$ sudo vgs
VG      #PV   #LV    #SN    Attr      VSize     VFree
centos    1     2      0    wz--n-    7.51g     40.00m

 â–  Note  you will get more detailed information about volume groups if you use the vgdisplay command.

There is one volume group, called centos, which was created by the installer.
