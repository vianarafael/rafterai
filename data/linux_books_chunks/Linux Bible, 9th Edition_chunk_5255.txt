To remedy that, you 
need to expand the permissions of the mask. One way to do that is with the chmod 
command, as follows:

[mjones]$ chmod 775 /tmp/mydir/newfile.txt
[mjones]$ getfacl /tmp/mydir/newfile.txt
# file: tmp/mydir/newfile.txt
# owner: mjones
# group: mjones
user::rwx
user:adm:rwx
group::rwx
mask::rwx
other::r-x
