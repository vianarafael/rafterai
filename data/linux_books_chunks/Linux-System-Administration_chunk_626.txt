A computer starts booting the moment you turn on the power (no kidding). This first process
is called post or power on self test. If all goes well then this leads to the bios. If all goes
not so well, then you might hear nothing, or hear beeping, or see an error message on the
screen, or maybe see smoke coming out of the computer (burning hardware smells bad!).
