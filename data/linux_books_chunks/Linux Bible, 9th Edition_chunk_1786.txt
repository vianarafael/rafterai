If you 
attempt a regular install, the system responds with “nothing to do.” You must, instead, use the 
reinstall subcommand. For example, suppose you installed the zsh package and then deleted 
/bin/zsh by mistake. You could restore the missing components by typing the following:

# yum reinstall zsh

You can remove a single package with the erase subcommand.
