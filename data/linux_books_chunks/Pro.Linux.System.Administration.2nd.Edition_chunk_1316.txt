NetworkManager will integrate with the older style (LSB) files 
for managing network interfaces too via a LSB network service.

NetworkManager integrates and configures Domain Name System (DNS) resolution via the Dnsmasq 

program (a local DNS server) and handles configuring and setting up VPN and wireless connections.

We talked about systemd and about about the multi-user.target in Chapter 6 and this is what brings 

up the NetworkManager.
