If either of these devices should fail, our spare (/dev/sde) will be automatically activated and synchronized.

You can also quickly see your RAID device by querying the /proc filesystem:

$ cat /proc/mdstat
Personalities : [raid1]
md0 : active raid1 sde[2](S) sdd[1] sdc[0]
      8383424 blocks super 1.2 [2/2] [UU]

unused devices: <none>

We can see the [UU] and that tells us both devices [2/2] are Up.
