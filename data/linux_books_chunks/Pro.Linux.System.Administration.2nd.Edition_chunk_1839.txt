If 

the repository is disabled, meaning we donâ€™t normally fetch packages from this repository, we can enable the 
repository while we execute this command. Subsequent yum commands will not fetch from this repository 
unless specified. More on YUM repositories shortly.

Finally, you can clean your cache directory (where YUM temporarily stores the packages you have 

downloaded).
