In the options part of each entry in /etc/exports, you can add options that 
allow or limit access by setting read/write permission. These options, which are passed to 
NFS, are as follows:

 ■ ro—Client can mount this exported ﬁ lesystem read-only. The default is to mount 

the ﬁ lesystem read/write.

 ■ rw—Explicitly asks that a shared directory be shared with read/write permissions.
