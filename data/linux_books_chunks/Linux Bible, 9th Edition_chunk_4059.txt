You 
cannot track individual use of the root account. To allow tracking of root account use by indi-
viduals, a policy for using sudo (see Chapter 8) instead of logging into root should be instituted.

Instead of giving multiple people root permission on a Linux system, you can grant root 
access on a per-command basis with the sudo command.
