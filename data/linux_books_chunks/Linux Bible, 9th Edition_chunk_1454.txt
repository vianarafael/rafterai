However, if you want to set 
up the system to do virtualization, you need a 64-bit processor (x86_64).

If you have a 486 machine (at least 100 MHz), consider trying Damn Small Linux (http://www.damnsmall-
linux.org) or Slackware (http://www.slackware.org). It wonâ€™t have the same graphical interface, but 
you could do some of the shell exercises.
