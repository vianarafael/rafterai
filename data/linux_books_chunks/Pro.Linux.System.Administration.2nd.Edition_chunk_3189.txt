If an e-mail server responds, it will try to submit the e-mail.

If an e-mail server does not respond, your e-mail server will try the next server 
returned from the MX record in sequence.

If no e-mail servers respond, your e-mail server will usually queue your e-mail to 
try again later.

If, after continued failures, the e-mail still canâ€™t be delivered, the e-mail server 
will report failure to the user via an e-mail.

The destination server your e-mail server tries to send to could be the final destination of your e-mail, 

or it could merely be a gateway that your e-mail passes through onto one or more further e-mail servers until 
it finally reaches its destination.
