AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS 

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or 
on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from the 
compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
