However, if you are running CentOS, you will not be able to send metrics to port 2013 without 
modifying SELinux.

You can issue the following to allow Collectd to connect to the network using tcp:

$ sudo getsebool collectd_tcp_network_connect
collectd_tcp_network_connect --> off
$ sudo setsebool collectd_tcp_network_connect on

You should also check /var/log/audit/audit.log for any denied messages.

Checking Logs

Once we have restarted our carbon-cache, carbon-relay, and collectd service, you should see them making 
connections to the services in the logs.

Collectd will log to syslog in our configuration, and Graphite will log into the /var/log/carbon 

directory.
