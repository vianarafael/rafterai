We need to remove the # from 

the following line:

/etc/bareos/bareos-sd.conf
...<snip>...
@/etc/bareos/bareos-sd.d/device-gluster.conf
...<snip>...

We now need to reload our configuration so that the Bareos Storage daemon will add in the device-

gluster.conf file. Using bconsole, we can issue the reload command, or we can restart using the normal 
systemctl commands.
