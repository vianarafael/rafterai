The focus of this section is setting the bits that help you 
create directories to use for collaboration.

As with read, write, and execute bits for user, group, and other, these special Ô¨Å le 
 permission bits can be set with the chmod command. If, for example, you run chmod 
775 /mnt/xyz, the implied permission is actually 0775.
