A
disadvantage is that file system checks on ext2 can take a long time.

ext2 was being replaced by ext3 on most Linux machines. They are essentially the same,
except for the journaling which is only present in ext3.

Journaling  means  that  changes  are  first  written  to  a  journal  on  the  disk.  The  journal  is
flushed regularly, writing the changes in the file system.
