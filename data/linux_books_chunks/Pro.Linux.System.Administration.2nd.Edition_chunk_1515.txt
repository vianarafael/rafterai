if it is set to 1, iP forwarding will 
redirect those packets not destined for it to their destination host.

to make the setting persistent across reboots, you need to uncomment the following line in /etc/
sysctl.conf, save the file, and then issue the sysctl â€“p command to load the changes into the 
kernel:

# Uncomment the next line to enable packet forwarding for IPv4
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

You can also immediately turn on packet forwarding by echoing the number 1 into the file /proc/sys/ 
net/ipv4/ip_forward like this:

echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

this change is not persistent across reboots, but editing /etc/sysctl will make it permanent.

You can also configure iP forwarding for iPv6 interfaces as well.
