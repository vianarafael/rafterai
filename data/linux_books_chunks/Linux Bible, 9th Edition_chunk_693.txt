First, 
the find command starts at the /home directory and prints out all ﬁ les and directories 
below that point in the ﬁ lesystem. The output is piped to the grep command, which ﬁ lters 
out all ﬁ les except for those that include the string xyzzy in the ﬁ lename. Finally, the vi 
command opens all ﬁ lenames for editing (one at a time) that include xyzzy.
