This is something to keep 

in mind when choosing a registrar to buy your domain from, as it’s a relatively convenient way for spammers 
to collect e-mail addresses.

 ■ Note  Most registrars allow only a limited number of lookups per day from a specific address against their 
database, to discourage address harvesting.

Querying Name Servers
You will already be using the DNS server or servers run by your Internet service provider to look up 
addresses for hosts on the Internet.
