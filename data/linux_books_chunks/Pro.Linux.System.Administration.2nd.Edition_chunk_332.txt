You gain access to the repository using your SSH public key for 
authentication on the githost.com server. Git will then make a copy of the git-repository.git repository on 
your local filesystem in a directory of the same name.

Once you have a copy of the repository you can begin to make your changes. One of the first steps is to 
create a branch.
