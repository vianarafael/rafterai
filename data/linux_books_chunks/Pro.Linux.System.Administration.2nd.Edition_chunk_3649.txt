Our 
host needs to match the following configuration:

$ hostname –s
dc1
$ hostname –d
samba.example.com

It is a good idea to add dc1.samba.example.com to your /etc/hosts file too.

127.0.0.1   localhost dc1 dc1.samba.example.com

Also, because we are going to let Samba manage its own DNS subdomain, we need to allow it access to 

bind configuration.
