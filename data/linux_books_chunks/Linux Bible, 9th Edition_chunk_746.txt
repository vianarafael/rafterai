To prevent being logged off while you are working, you may 
want to set the value to something like TMOUT=1800 (to allow 30 minutes of idle 
time). You can use any terminal session to close the current shell after a set num-

 ■ PATH—As described earlier, the PATH variable sets the directories that are 

searched for commands you use.
