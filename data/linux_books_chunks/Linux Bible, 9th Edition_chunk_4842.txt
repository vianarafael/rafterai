In cloud computing, the operating systems serving cloud users are not running directly on 
computer hardware. Instead, hypervisors are conÔ¨Å gured to run many operating systems as 
what are referred to as virtual machines.

Depending on your cloud environment, you may hear a hypervisor referred to as a  compute 
node or simply as a host.
