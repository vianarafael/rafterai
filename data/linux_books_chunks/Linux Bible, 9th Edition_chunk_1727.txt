Then it gathers those 
binaries together with documentation, conﬁ guration ﬁ les, scripts, and other components 
available from the upstream provider.

After gathering all those components into the RPM, the RPM package is signed (so users 
can test the package for validity) and placed in a repository of RPMs for the speciﬁ c distri-
bution and architecture (32-bit x86, 64-bit x86, and so on).
