This directory is used by Linux’s 
filesystem repair tools, which we’ll look at later in the section “Recovering from Failure.”

When you no longer need the filesystem, you can unmount it from your host using the umount 

command.

$ sudo umount /mnt/data
umount: /mnt/data: target is busy
        (In some cases useful info about processes that
         use the device is found by lsof(8) or fuser(1).)
$ pwd
/mnt/data

What is happening here? The command umount is refusing to unmount the directory because it 
contains files or directories that are in use.
