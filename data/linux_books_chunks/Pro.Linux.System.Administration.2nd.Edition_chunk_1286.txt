An 
interface can have many aliases, or you can bond or team two or more interfaces together to appear as one 
interface.

Linux gives you the ability to have multiple IP addresses on a single interface. The interface uses the 

same Mac address for all IP addresses. A bonded, or teamed, interface consists of two or more network 
interfaces appearing as a single interface.
