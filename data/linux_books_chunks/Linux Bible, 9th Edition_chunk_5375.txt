To share a directory /var/mystuff from your NFS server as available to everyone, 
read-only, and with the root user on the client having root access to the share, ﬁ rst 
create the mount directory as follows:

# mkdir /var/mystuff

Then create an entry in the /etc/exports ﬁ le that is similar to the following:

/var/mystuff   *(ro,no_root_squash,insecure)

To make the share available, type the following:

# exportfs -v -a
exporting *:/var/mystuff
