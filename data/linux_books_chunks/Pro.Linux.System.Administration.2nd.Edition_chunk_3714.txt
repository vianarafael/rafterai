To do that, we 

disable tbearâ€™s details like so:

$ sudo samba-tool user disable tbear
Disabled user tbear

If we wanted to remove him completely, we would use samba-tool user delete.
Next we are going to create our sales group, and then we will add jsmith and bsingh to it. We use 

samba-tool again via the group subcommand.
