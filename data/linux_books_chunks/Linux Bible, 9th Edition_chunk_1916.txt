Replace user_id with 

the ID number (for example, -u 1474).

 ■ -U—Unlocks the user account (by removing the exclamation mark at the beginning 

of the encrypted password).

The following are examples of the usermod command:

# usermod -s /bin/csh chris
# usermod -Ga sales,marketing, chris

The ﬁ rst example changes the shell to the csh shell for the user named chris.
