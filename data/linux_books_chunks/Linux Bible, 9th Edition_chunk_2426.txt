When you view the ﬁ le /tmp/jake (for example, 
less/tmp/jake), you will ﬁ nd all the ﬁ les that are owned by the user jake listed in size 
order. Here is the command line:

# find / -xdev -user jake -print | xargs ls -ldS > /tmp/jake

The -xdev option prevents fi lesystems other than the selected fi lesystem from being searched.
